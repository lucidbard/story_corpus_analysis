          "text": "The Baby\u2011sitters Club. I\u2019m proud to say it was totally my idea, even though the four of us worked it out together. \u201cUs\u201d is Mary Anne Spier, Claudia Kishi, Stacey McGill, and me \u2014 Kristy Thomas. But that was at the beginning of seventh grade, after the summer in which my friendship with Claudia nearly fell apart, Mary Anne began to find out who she was, Claudia experienced her first love, and an unhappy girl left New York City and moved to our town. It was quite a summer.\n\nWhen Mary Anne and Claudia and Stacey and I talked about it later (when we were older), we discovered that during those long hot months we had all, separately, felt that we didn\u2019t quite belong where we were. Not one of us. Up until that summer we hadn\u2019t paid much attention to such things. But now Mary Anne felt that she was suddenly teetering between childhood and teenagehood, or whatever you call it, and that she didn\u2019t fit into either world. Claudia felt that she was drifting away from Mary Anne and me, drifting toward her own teenagehood alone \u2014 while Mary Anne and I lingered on the shore. Stacey had survived a horrible year and had been shunned by her classmates and friends, and now her parents had decided to move the family here to Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where she knew absolutely no one. And I, Kristin Amanda Thomas, felt like a stranger in my family. I would look around at my mom and my brothers, who were oh\u2011so\u2011happy with Mom\u2019s new boyfriend, Watson, and I\u2019d think, How can they leave Dad behind? Am I the only one who still wants him to be part of the family? And so I decided to give my father a second chance.\n\nThe summer started off like most of the other summers of my life. But by the end of it, everything was different. We were different. And the summer brought the four of us, Claudia, Stacey, Mary Anne, and me, together to form the Baby\u2011sitters Club \u2014 something we would belong to, in one sense or another, for the rest of our lives.",

          "text": "When the bell rang at the end of the last day of sixth grade, I was ready. I had cleaned out my locker early that morning before school began \u2014 and I mean really cleaned it. With a tiny bottle of Fantastik and a bunch of paper towels that I had stuffed into my backpack before I left home. I had removed every last scrap of paper from the locker, every old eraser, every gum wrapper and paper clip and pencil stub, plus one gray sock, and thrown them away (including the sock, which smelled). Then I had scrubbed the locker down with the Fantastik. I wasn\u2019t taking any chances on being called at home in a day or two about the condition of my locker. I did not want to have to set foot in Stoneybrook Middle School again until September, when seventh grade would begin. So when that last bell rang, I ran from my language arts class (calling a hasty and not at all heartfelt good\u2011bye over my shoulder to Mrs. Alpin, whom I loathed) directly to the front door of SMS, where I met Mary Anne, my best friend in the world. Mary Anne had also cleaned her locker thoroughly that morning, and the two of us had not one single school responsibility left.\n\nWe had to wait for Claudia, though. Claud had not thought quite as far ahead as we had, and she still had to deal with her locker and also have a chat with her math teacher, whose class she had not exactly flunked but hadn\u2019t quite passed, either. These were Claud\u2019s words, and while they didn\u2019t make sense to me, I didn\u2019t care. School was out!\n\n\u201cYou know what my grandmother used to shout on the last day of school?\u201d I said to Mary Anne as we waited, lolling against the door frame and watching kids stream past us, calling and hooting.\n\n\u201cNo. What?\u201d I could tell that Mary Anne was impatient for Claudia to show up.\n\n\u201cShe used to shout, \u2018School\u2019s out! School\u2019s out! Teacher wore her bloomers out!\u2019 \u201d\n\nMary Anne stared at me. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she said finally.\n\n\u201cWell, how should I know? It just sounds funny.\u201d\n\nMary Anne twirled the end of one brown braid thoughtfully around her finger. \u201cMaybe \u2014\u201d she started to say.\n\nBut I interrupted her. \u201cThere\u2019s Claudia.\u201d\n\nMary Anne turned around and we saw Claud coming toward us through the crowded corridor at a pace ordinarily reserved for snails and turtles. She was walking arm in arm with Dori Wallingford. Howie Johnson and Pete Black were flanking them.\n\n\u201cDori,\u201d Mary Anne muttered.\n\n\u201cBoys,\u201d I muttered.\n\nClaudia and Mary Anne and I used to sit together at lunch sometimes, but that had changed between our winter break and our spring break. Dori and several other girls who were more interested in clothes than in practically anything else had suddenly become more interesting to Claudia than Mary Anne and me or practically anyone else. Except boys.\n\nClaudia waved cheerfully to her new friends. \u201cSee you!\u201d she called as Dori and Howie and Pete crossed the lawn to the line of waiting school buses. \u201cHi, you guys,\u201d she said to Mary Anne and me, and for an instant I felt like something hanging on the Reduced rack at Bellair\u2019s Department Store.\n\n\u201cHey, Claud,\u201d said Mary Anne as we began our walk to Bradford Court, \u201cwhat do you think \u2018Teacher wore her bloomers out\u2019 means?\u201d",

I\u2019m proud to say it was totally my idea, even though the four of us worked it out together. \u201cUs\u201d is Mary Anne Spier, Claudia Kishi, Stacey McGill, and me\u2014Kristy Thomas.\n\nI got the idea on the first Tuesday afternoon of seventh grade. It was a very hot day. It was so hot that in my un-air-conditioned school, Stoneybrook Middle School, the teachers had opened every single window and door and turned off all the lights. My hair stuck damply to the back of my neck, and I wished I had a rubber band so I could pull it into a long ponytail. Bees flew into the classroom and droned around our heads, and Mr. Redmont, our teacher, let us stop working to make fans out of construction paper. The fans didn\u2019t do much except keep the bees away, but it was nice to take up ten minutes of social studies making them.\n\nAnyway, that stifling afternoon dragged on forever, and when the hands of the clock on the front wall of our classroom finally hit 2:42 and the bell rang, I leaped out of my seat and shouted, \u201cHooray!\u201d I was just so glad that it was time to get out of there. I like school and everything, but sometimes enough is enough.\n\nMr. Redmont looked shocked. He was probably thinking he\u2019d been so nice letting us make fans, and there I was, not appreciating it at all, just glad the day was over.\n\nI felt bad, but I couldn\u2019t help what I\u2019d done. I\u2019m like that. I think of something to say, and I say it. I think of something to do, and I do it. Mom calls it impulsive. Sometimes she calls it trouble. But she doesn\u2019t just mean trouble. She means trouble.\n\nAnd I was in trouble then. I could sense it. I\u2019ve been in enough trouble to know when it\u2019s coming.\n\nMr. Redmont cleared his throat. He was trying to think of a way to punish me without humiliating me in front of the other kids. Things like that are important to him.\n\n\u201cKristy,\u201d Mr. Redmont began, and then he changed his mind and started over. \u201cClass,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have your homework assignments. You may go. Kristy, I\u2019d like to see you for a minute.\u201d\n\nWhile the rest of the kids gathered up their books and papers and left the room, talking and giggling, I made my way up to Mr. Redmont\u2019s desk. Before he could say a word, I began apologizing to him. Sometimes that helps.\n\n\u201cMr. Redmont,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I didn\u2019t mean anything. I mean, I didn\u2019t mean I was glad school was over. I meant I was glad I could go home. Because my house is air-conditioned\u2026.\u201d\n\nMr. Redmont nodded. \u201cBut do you think, Kristy, that it would be possible, in the future, for you to conduct yourself with a bit more decorum?\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure of the exact meaning of decorum, but I had a pretty good idea it meant not spoiling Mr. Redmont\u2019s day by jumping up and shouting hooray when the bell rang.\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I said. Sometimes being polite also helps.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Mr. Redmont. \u201cBut I want you to remember this incident, and the best way for us to remember things is to write them down. So tonight, I would like you to write a one-hundred-word essay on the importance of decorum in the classroom.\u201d\n\nDarn. I\u2019d have to find out what decorum meant after all.\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I said again.\n\nI went back to my desk, gathered up my books very slowly, and then walked very slowly out of the classroom. I hoped Mr. Redmont was noticing the slowness because I was betting it was an important part of decorum.\n\nI found Mary Anne Spier waiting for me outside the door to my classroom. She was leaning against the wall, biting her nails.\n\nMary Anne is my best friend. We live next door to each other. We even look a little alike. We\u2019re both small for our age and we both have brown hair that falls past our shoulders. But that\u2019s where the similarity ends, because I can\u2019t keep my mouth shut, and Mary Anne is very quiet and very shy. Luckily, that\u2019s only on the outside. The people who know her well, like Claudia and Stacey and me, get to see the inside of her, and the Mary Anne who\u2019s hiding in there is a lot of fun.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d I greeted her. I pulled her hand out of her mouth and looked at her nails. \u201cMary Anne! How do you ever expect to be able to wear nail polish if you keep doing that?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cNail polish. I\u2019ll be seventy-five before my father lets me wear it.\u201d\n\nMary Anne\u2019s father is the only family she\u2019s got. Her mother is dead, and she has no brothers or sisters. Unfortunately, her father is pretty strict. My mother says it\u2019s just because Mr. Spier is nervous since Mary Anne is all he\u2019s got. You\u2019d think, though, that he could let her wear her hair down instead of always in braids, or give her permission to ride her bike to the mall with Claudia and me once in a while. But no. At Mr. Spier\u2019s house it\u2019s rules, rules, rules. It\u2019s a miracle that Mary Anne was even allowed to become a member of the Baby-sitters Club.\n\nWe walked out of school, and suddenly I began running. I forgot all about decorum, because I\u2019d just remembered something else. \u201cOh, my gosh!\u201d I cried.\n\nMary Anne raced after me. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she panted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Tuesday,\u201d I called over my shoulder.\n\n\u201cSo? Slow down, Kristy. It\u2019s too hot to run.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t slow down. Tuesday is my afternoon to watch David Michael. I\u2019m supposed to beat him home. Otherwise he gets home first and has to watch himself.\u201d\n\nDavid Michael is my six-year-old brother.\n\nMy big brothers, Charlie and Sam, and I are each responsible for him one afternoon a week until Mom gets home from work. Kathy, this fifteen-year-old girl who lives a few blocks from us, watches him the other two afternoons. Kathy gets paid to watch him. Charlie and Sam and I don\u2019t.\n\nMary Anne and I ran all the way home. We reached my front yard, sweaty and out of breath. And there was David Michael, sitting forlornly on the front steps, his dark curls falling limply across his forehead.\n\nHe burst into tears as soon as he saw us.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked. I sat down beside him and put my arm around his shoulders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m locked out,\u201d he wailed.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to your key?\u201d\n\nDavid",

So Kristy had this idea that the three of us should get together to form a group of baby\u2011sitters, advertise ourselves, and have a little business, which is just what we did. Plus, we asked a new friend of mine, Stacey McGill, to join, which she did. The Baby\u2011sitters Club is working really well. People know about us and call us all the time, and each of us has more jobs now than before the Baby\u2011sitters Club, so it was important that I be allowed to stay in it.

I\u2019m supposed to try to do the work on my own, but one of them sits next to me to keep me from daydreaming, to make sure I do each assignment completely, to see that I follow directions and stuff, and to answer questions if I have them. They\u2019re not supposed to do the homework for me, but sometimes I can get Janine to give me answers. This is because my dumb homework is so boring for her, as she tells me at least twice every time she has to help me, that she\u2019ll do anything to speed it along. Well, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not up to trigonomulus, or whatever it is she does. We can\u2019t all be scholars.\n\nMimi, my grandmother, is the best person to help me. She\u2019s quiet and soft\u2011spoken and endlessly patient. My family is Japanese, and Mimi and my grandfather (who died long before I was born) brought my mother to the United States when Mom was just a little girl. Mom has no accent whatsoever (neither does my father, who also came to the United States as a small child), but Mimi has this pleasant, rolling accent that reminds me of a ship at sea. And she is polite, polite, polite, never speaking a harsh word.\n\nI got out my social studies text.\n\n\u201cWhat do we have between the covers of this book?\u201d asked Mimi, who thinks books are eyes into the hearts and lives of other people (peoples?). She told me so once.\n\n\u201cSocial studies,\u201d I replied. \u201cWe read chapter three in class today. Now we have to answer the discussion questions at the end of the chapter\u2026. Mimi, if they\u2019re discussion questions, why aren\u2019t we discussing them? How come Mr. Miller is making us write them down?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know, my Claudia, but if that is the assignment, then you must complete it as your teacher wishes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Boy, did I know. A few weeks ago, I would have written down one\u2011word answers or skipped the assignment altogether. Now there was no way out.\n\nI began to write. Mimi looked on, every now and then pointing out a misspelled word or suggesting that I check my punctuation. After social studies came math and then English, and at last I was done. I breathed a sigh that was relief mixed with boredom.\n\n\u201cAnd what are you going to do now, my Claudia?\u201d asked Mimi.\n\n\u201cGet back to The Phantom of Pine Hill,\u201d I replied, slapping my English text closed.",

          "text": "\u201cAs president of the Baby-sitters Club,\u201d said Kristy Thomas, \u201cI hereby move that we figure out what to do when Mrs. Newton goes to the hospital to have her baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWell, we ought to be prepared. We\u2019ve been waiting for this baby for months, and the Newtons are practically our best clients. They\u2019ll need someone to take care of Jamie while his parents are at the hospital. Smart baby-sitters would be ready for the occasion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d spoke up Mary Anne Spier. \u201cI second the motion.\u201d Mary Anne usually agrees with Kristy. After all, they\u2019re best friends.\n\nI glanced across the room at Claudia Kishi. Claudia is my best friend, and vice president of our club. She shrugged her shoulders at me.\n\nThere are just the four of us in the Baby-sitters Club: Kristy, Claudia, Mary Anne (she\u2019s the secretary), and me, Stacey McGill. I\u2019m the treasurer. We\u2019ve been in business for about two months. Kristy thought up the club, which was why she got to be president. We meet three times a week from five-thirty to six o\u2019clock in Claudia\u2019s room (Claudia has a private phone), and our clients call then to line us up as sitters. The reason the club works so well is that with four baby-sitters there at the phone, each person who calls is pretty much guaranteed to get a sitter for whatever time he or she needs. Our clients like that. They say that having to make a whole bunch of calls just to line up one sitter is a waste of time. They like us, too. We\u2019re good baby-sitters. And we worked hard to get our business going. We printed up flyers and distributed them in mailboxes, and even put an ad in The Stoneybrook News, the voice of Stoneybrook, Connecticut.\n\nThat\u2019s where I live now, in this teeny-weeny town in Connecticut. Let me tell you, it\u2019s quite a shock after life in New York City. New York is a big place. Stoneybrook is not. There is only one middle school here, and I go to it. We all do. (We\u2019re in seventh grade.) In New York there are about a billion middle schools. In fact, in New York there are about a billion of everything\u2014people, cars,buildings, stores, pigeons, friends, and things to do.\n\nHere there\u2019s, well, there\u2019s \u2026 not much, really. My parents and I moved into our house in August and I didn\u2019t make a single friend until I met Claudia in school in September. Everyone here seems to have known everyone else since they were babies. Claudia, Kristy, and Mary Anne have. And they\u2019ve grown up together, since Kristy and Mary Anne live next door to each other on Bradford Court and Claudia lives across the street from them. (I live two streets away.)\n\nSo, was I ever glad when Claudia told me Kristy wanted to start the club! Friends at last, I thought. And that\u2019s just what I found. Even though I\u2019m better friends with Claudia, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without Kristy and Mary Anne. It\u2019s true that they seem younger than Claudia and me (they don\u2019t care much about clothes or boys yet\u2014although Kristy did just go to her first dance), and Mary Anne is unbelievably shy, and Kristy\u2019s sort of a tomboy. But they\u2019re my friends, and I belong with them. Which is more than I can say about certain traitors I left behind in New York.\n\n\u201cAll right, here\u2019s one plan,\u201d Kristy was saying. \u201cIt\u2019s a school afternoon. Mrs. Newton realizes that it\u2019s time to go to the hospital. She calls Mr. Newton or a cab or whatever, then calls us, and one of us goes to stay with Jamie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if we\u2019re all busy?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Kristy. \u201cMaybe from now on, one of us should be free each afternoon so Mrs. Newton will be guaranteed a baby-sitter. It will be a special service for her, since the Newtons are such good customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat seems like kind of a waste,\u201d spoke up Claudia, which was exactly what I was thinking.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I said. \u201cBabies can be late. Two or three weeks late. We could be giving up an awful lot of perfectly good afternoons for nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said Kristy thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cHow about a nighttime plan?\u201d I suggested. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem that pregnant women always rush off to the hospital in the middle of the night? I was born at two-twenty-two A.M.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was born at four-thirty-six A.M.,\u201d said Claudia.\n\n\u201cI was born at four A.M. on the dot,\u201d said Kristy.\n\nWe looked at Mary Anne. She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know what time I was born.\u201d Mary Anne\u2019s mother died when Mary Anne was little, and Mary Anne is not very close to her strict father. It figures that they\u2019d never talked about the day (or night) she was born.\n\nA knock came on Claudia\u2019s door. Mimi, her grandmother, stuck her head in the room. \u201cHello, girls,\u201d she said politely.\n\n\u201cHi, Mimi,\u201d we answered.\n\n\u201cMay I offer you something to eat?\u201d she asked. Claudia\u2019s family is Japanese, and Mimi, who didn\u2019t come to the United States until she was thirty-two years old, speaks with a gentle, rolling accent. She has lived with Claudia\u2019s family since before Claudia was born.\n\n\u201cNo thanks, Mimi,\u201d replied Claudia, \u201cbut maybe you could help us.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d Mimi opened the door the rest of the way and stood just inside the room.\n\n\u201cDo you know what time Mary Anne was born?\u201d Claudia asked. She figured Mimi would know since Claudia\u2019s parents have been friendly with the Thomases and the Spiers for years, and Mimi had gotten to know the families, too.\n\nMimi looked only slightly taken aback. \u201cLet me think for a moment, my Claudia\u2026. Mary Anne, your mother and father left for the hospital around dinnertime. That I remember clearly. I believe you were born near eleven o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d A grin lit up Mary Anne\u2019s face. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. So I was another nighttime baby. Thank you, Mimi.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d Mimi turned to leave, and almost bumped into Janine, Claudia\u2019s sister, who had come up behind her.\n\n\u201cClaudia! Claudia!\u201d cried Janine.\n\nI looked up in alarm. Janine is this prim, not-much-fun fifteen-year-old who\u2019s a genius. To be honest, she\u2019s boring. Dull as dishwater. I\u2019d never even heard her raise her voice, which was why, the minute I heard her cry \u201cClaudia!",

We\u2019ve grown up together. And since my mother died when I was really little, leaving just Dad and me, Kristy\u2019s been like my sister, and Mrs. Thomas is like my mother. (Kristy\u2019s parents got divorced a few years ago and her dad walked out, but my father has not been like a father to Kristy.

Claudia and Janine were born in the United States. Both of their parents came to America when they were little. Mimi was in her thirties, I think, when she left Japan, so she still speaks with an accent. I like her accent. It\u2019s soft and nice to listen to.\n\n\"Hi, Mimi,\" we replied.\n\n\"How is the scarf coming, Mary Anne?\" she asked. (Mimi taught me how to knit. She\u2019s helping me make a scarf for my father.)\n\n\"It\u2019s fine,\" I said. \"I\u2019m almost done, but I\u2019ll need you to help me with the fringe.\"\n\n\"Of course.

She\u2019s only fifteen and already she\u2019s taking classes at Stoneybrook University. She corrects absolutely everything you say to her. Kristy and I avoid her as much as possible.\n\nThat day, we were lucky. Janine wasn\u2019t even home. When we ran by her room, it was dark.\n\n\"Hi!\" we greeted Claudia.\n\n\"Hi,\" she replied, her voice muffled. Claudia had her head in her pajama bag as she rummaged around at the bottom of it. In a moment she straightened up, proudly holding out three Ring Dings.\n\nClaudia is a junk-food addict. She buys candy and Twinkies and Yodels and other things and hides the stuff all over her room. She eats it at any time (and eats her meals, too) and never seems to gain an ounce, or to get so much as the hint of a pimple.\n\nShe handed us each a Ring Ding, but I turned mine down. Dad gets upset if I don\u2019t eat a proper dinner (or breakfast or lunch), and I don\u2019t have a very big appetite. Claudia tossed the Ring Ding back in her pajama bag. She wasn\u2019t going to offer it to Stacey when she arrived, since Stacey has diabetes and can\u2019t eat most sweets.\n\n\"Any calls yet?\" I asked. It was just barely 5:30, but sometimes our clients called early.\n\n\"One,\" replied Claudia. \"Kristy\u2019s mom. She needs someone for David Michael on Thursday.\"\n\nKristy nodded. \"Our regular two-day-a-week sitter finally quit. Mom\u2019ll be calling more often for a while.\"\n\nKristy has two brothers in high school, Sam and Charlie, and a little brother, David Michael, who\u2019s six. Sam, Charlie, and Kristy are each responsible for David Michael one afternoon a week. Mrs. Thomas had had a baby-sitter lined up for him for the other two days, but I knew the sitter had been canceling a lot.\n\n\"Hey, everybody!\" called a voice. Stacey entered Claudia\u2019s room, looking gorgeous, as usual.\n\nIf you ask Stacey, she\u2019ll tell you she\u2019s plain, but that\u2019s crazy. Stacey is glamorous. She moved to Stoneybrook, Connecticut, from New York City last summer. She\u2019s very sophisticated, and is even allowed to have her hair professionally styled, so that she has this fabulous-looking shaggy blonde mane, and she wears the neatest clothes \u2014 big, baggy shirts and tight-fitting pants \u2014 and amazing jewelry, like parrots and palm trees. She even has a pair of earrings that consist of a dog for one ear and a bone for the other ear.\n\nI\u2019d give anything to be Stacey. Not to have diabetes, of course, but to have lived in New York City and to be able to dress up like a model every day. My father lets me dress like a model, too \u2014 a model of a six-year-old. I have to wear my hair in braids (that\u2019s a rule), and he has to approve my outfit every day, which is sort of silly since he buys all m",

The other girls in the club have titles, like Mary Anne Spier, secretary, or Claudia Kishi, vice president. But I'm just me.\n\nThe club is the most important thing in my life. If it weren't for the club, I wouldn't be riding my bicycle off to another baby-sitting job at this very moment. And if it weren't for all the babysitting jobs I've gotten, I wouldn't know so many people here in Stoneybrook.\n\nSee, I've only lived in Connecticut a few months. Until this past January, I lived in California with my parents and my younger brother, Jeff. But last fall Mom and Dad split up, and Mom decided to move back to the place where she grew up. Her parents still live here. So right after Christmas, Jeff and I were uprooted from hot, sunny California and transplanted to cold, sloppy Connecticut, where (so far) it's never been warm enough for me.\n\nI hate cold weather. On the days when the temperature slips back a few degrees, I yell at the weatherman. On the days when it creeps up, I congratulate him and apologize for yelling. I'm still not sure what the big deal about New England winters is all about. Back in California, we had one season: summer. I thought it was wonderful. I loved the beach, I loved sunshine, I loved eighty-degree Christmases. Why, I wondered, would anyone want to interrupt all that warmth with three other seasons?",

          "text": "The family I was baby-sitting for that afternoon was the Pikes. There are eight Pike children \u2014 and three of them are triplets! However, I wasn't going to sit for all of them. The triplets, who are nine-year-old boys, would be at ice hockey practice (my brother Jeff was there, too), and eight-year-old Vanessa would be at her violin lesson. That left Nicky, who's seven; Margo (six); Claire (four); and Mallory, who's ten and usually a big help.\n\nWhen I reached the Pikes', I parked my bicycle at the side of the driveway and rang the doorbell.\n\n\"I'll get it! I'll get it!\" cried a voice from inside.\n\nThe door was flung open by Claire, the youngest Pike. She loves answering the door and the phone.\n\n\"Hi, Claire!\" I said brightly.\n\nClaire suddenly turned shy. She put her finger in her mouth and looked at the floor. \"Hi,\" she replied.\n\n\"I'm Dawn. Remember me?\"\n\nClaire nodded.\n\n\"Can I come in?\"\n\nShe nodded again.\n\nAs I was opening the door, Mrs. Pike ran down the stairs. \"Oh, it's you, Dawn. Terrific! You're right on time. How are you?\"\n\n\"Fine, thanks,\" I answered.\n\nI really like Mrs. Pike. She has lots of energy and she loves kids. (She'd have to, I guess.) She's patient and funny and hardly ever yells. She and Mr. Pike have been really nice to our family ever since we moved here.\n\n\"I'm just going to be at a meeting of the trustees of the public library. The library number is on the bulletin board by the phone. If you need to call me, ask for the Prescott Room and say that I'm in the board meeting, okay?\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n(Mrs. Pike is always so organized. She's a baby-sitter's dream.)\n\n\"The emergency numbers are in their usual spot, and the kids can have a snack \u2014 a small one \u2014 if they're hungry. I'll be home a little after five. Is that all right?\"\n\n\"Perfect. We have a Baby-sitters Club meeting at five-thirty.\"",

She's the one who had the idea for the club.\n\nThe vice president is Claudia Kishi, who's really neat and sophisticated. She lives across the street from Kristy. We hold our meetings in Claudia's room because she has a phone. Claudia is Japanese and beautiful. She hates school, but loves art and mystery stories. She's a little bit hard to get to know.\n\nThe club treasurer is Stacey McGill. Stacey moved to Stoneybrook just a few months before I did, so we have something in common. She came from New York City, and I know she had trouble getting adjusted to small-town life. Sometimes we talk about that.\n\nThen there's Mary Anne Spier. She's the one who introduced me to Kristy, Claudia, and Stacey. She's the secretary of the club and responsible for the Baby-sitters Club Record Book, which is where she records our job appointments, as well as the phone numbers and addresses of our clients and stuff like that. (Also in that book is a record of the money we earn. Stacey's in charge of that section.)\n\nWe keep a Baby-sitters Club Notebook, too, which is like a diary. Kristy insists that we write up each job we take and that we all read the book every few days. That's so we know what's going on in the families the club sits for.\n\nThe most important thing about Mary Anne (to me, anyway) is that she's my new best friend. (My old best friend was Sunny Winslow in California.) Mary Anne lives next door to Kristy Thomas, and for the longest time Kristy was her only best friend. Now I'm Mary Anne's other best friend.",

Not only that, they dated \u2014 for a long time. They were really serious about each other. Mary Anne and I found all this romantic stuff they'd written to each other in their senior yearbooks.\n\nEven more amazing is that they've started dating each other again! (Mary Anne's mother died when Mary Anne was really little.) Mary Anne and I can hardly believe that our parents are out. It's so exciting! Mr. Spier is this stern, lonely guy who needs some fun in his life (and something to think about besides Mary Anne, who's his only kid). And my mom has been so sad since the divorce.

When he died, his ghost stayed behind. I'm telling you, he haunts our attic.\"\n\nKaren Brewer looked at me with wide eyes. \"Honest, Kristy. He haunts our attic,\" she repeated. Karen loves to talk about witches and ghosts. She thinks her next-door neighbor, old Mrs. Porter, is a witch named Morbidda Destiny.\n\nKaren's four-year-old brother, Andrew, turned to me with eyes as round as an owl's. He didn't say a word.\n\n\"I think you're scaring your brother,\" I told Karen.\n\n\"No, she's not,\" whispered Andrew. I leaned over to him. \"Are you sure?\" I whispered back.\n\n\"No.\" I could barely hear him.\n\n\"I think that's enough talk about ghosts,\" I said.\n\n\"Okay,\" replied Karen. Her tone of voice implied that it was foolish of me not to arm myself with information about old Ben. \"But when you move into our house, you'll wish you knew more about my great-great-grandfather. Especially if you get a bedroom on the third floor.\" Karen made \"the third floor\" sound like Frankenstein's castle.\n\nI couldn't help giving a little shiver.

          "text": "Karen and Andrew are the children of Watson Brewer, who is engaged to my mother, the divorced Elizabeth Thomas. This means that when they get married, Karen and Andrew will become my little stepsister and stepbrother. It also means that my brothers and I will be moving out of our house on Bradford Court, where we grew up, and into Watson's house.\n\nThere are pros and cons to this situation. The pros are that Watson is rich. In fact, he's a millionaire. And his house isn't just a house, it's a mansion. Charlie and Sam, my older brothers, who have shared a room for years, will each have his own bedroom at Watson's. They could probably each have a suite of rooms if they asked nicely. And David Michael, my little brother (he just turned seven), will finally have a room bigger than a closet.\n\nI don't benefit at all where bedrooms are concerned since I already have my own and I think the size is fine. The main drawback to moving to Watson's is that he lives across town. I have never lived anywhere but right here on Bradford Court. All my friends are here. Mary Anne Spier lives next door, Claudia Kishi lives across the street, and Stacey McGill and Dawn Schafer live nearby. The five of us make up the Baby-sitters Club (I'm the president), and it won't be nearly as easy to run the club when I live clear on the other side of Stoneybrook, Connecticut.\n\nThe other \"con\" is that Watson is mostly okay, but sometimes he can be a jerk.\n\n\"Kristy? Karen? Andrew?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mom?\" It was a Saturday evening, and my mother had invited Watson and his kids over for dinner.",

And I know them well since I've been sitting for them off and on for about nine months, since the time the Baby-sitters Club began. Watson and their mother are divorced, and while they live with their mother, they do spend every other weekend and certain vacations with Watson, and some in-between time, too, if they want. The arrangement is pretty loose.\n\n\"Dinner's ready!\" called Mom.\n\n\"Come on, you guys,\" I said. \"You know what we're having?\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Andrew cautiously. He's a very picky eater.\n\n\"We're having spaghetti.\"\n\n\"Oh, yum!\" cried Karen.\n\n\"Pasketti?\" Andrew repeated. \"Jody Jones said pasketti is dead worms.\"\n\n\"Ew, ew, ew!\" exclaimed Karen.\n\n\"Well, Jody Jones is wrong,\" I told them. \"Spaghetti is ... noodles. That's all.\"\n\nWe entered through the back door of our house and went into the dining room. The table was set for eight. Candles were burning and the lights were dimmed. A bottle of red wine stood next to Watson's place. The dining room had been transformed into an Italian restaurant.\n\n\"This looks great, Mom,\" I said, \"but it's June. We should be eating outside. We're wasting the nice weather.\"\n\n\"Oh, honey,\" my mother replied. \"Eat spaghetti on our laps? That sounds like the start of a Tide commercial. We'll be much better off in here.\"\n\nI laughed. Ever since Mom got engaged to Watson, she's been in a great mood.\n\nMy brothers crowded around the table. (They're never too far off when food is about to be served.)\n\nKaren and Andrew approached them shyly. (Yes, even Karen gets shy sometimes.) I think she's shy around Charlie, Sam, and David Michael because she knows they're going to become her stepbrothers and she wants to make a good impression on them. She knows me a lot better than she knows them because of all the babysitting I've done for her and for Andrew.\n\n\"Hi, Charlie. Hi, Sam. Hi, David Michael,\" Karen addressed each one solemnly.\n\n\"Hi, kid,\" replied Charlie. (Charlie is my seventeen-year-old brother. He just got his driver's license.)\n\nSam, who's fifteen, couldn't answer Karen because he was busy scarfing up olives from a little dish my mother had set on the table next to the pepper grinder.\n\n\"Hey, Mom!\" I called into the kitchen. \"We need an olive refill.\"\n\nSam gave me a dirty look.\n\nWhile we kids stood around waiting for Mom and Watson, who were doing last-minute spaghetti things in the kitchen, Karen and David Michael eyed each other. Mom is afraid there's going to be some trouble between the two of them after the wedding. David Michael is used to being the baby of the family. He's not just the youngest, he's the much-youngest. There's a ten-year difference between Charlie and him. There's even a five-and-a-half-year difference between him and me. (I'll be thirteen in August.) But suddenly he's going to acquire a part-time six-year-old sister and four-year-old brother.\n\nMeanwhile, Karen is used to being the oldest. And she's going to acquire three part-time older brothers, plus me.\n\nFurthermore, Karen and David Michael are so close in age that Mom i",

This is because I don't like school.\n\nIn the summer, no one has to prod me. I like vacation and I love art classes. I love drawing and painting and crafts.\n\nI am thirteen years old, which means I am now officially a teenager. Mom says that doesn't mean much, because I've always been a teenager. By that, I think she means that I can be difficult to live with. I'm smart, but I don't like school or homework. My family is conservative, but I'm wild. I like loud clothes. I like to dance. I can be a real pain sometimes.\n\nOn the other hand, Janine, who is sixteen, has never been a teenager, according to my mother. Janine is smart and likes school. Actually, that's not quite right. She's super\u2011smart (a genius), and she doesn't just go to school. She goes, as I mentioned, to college. Well, she takes college courses, but she's still a high school student. She'll be a junior at Stoneybrook High this fall. Anyway, she never gives anybody a lick of trouble. She studies, studies, studies. My parents think she's wonderful. They brag to our relatives about how she's only sixteen and can handle college work. They expect her to become something really important, like a physicist.\n\nJanine wears clothes that are blah, blah, blah. When she outgrows them and passes them along to me, I pass them right along to Kristy Thomas or Mary Anne Spier, who live across the street. They don't care too much about clothes, but I wouldn't be caught dead in Janine's things. I'd rather have to pay for all new clothes with the money I earn baby\u2011sitting than wear Janine's free but yucky button\u2011down shirts, gray kilts, and crew\u2011neck sweaters.",

I was the second one into the kitchen.\n\nMimi greeted me in her gentle way. \"Good morning, my Claudia,\" she said softly. I hardly notice Mimi's accent anymore, but she does have one. Our family is Japanese, and Mimi, who is Mom's mother, didn't come to the United States until she was in her thirties. I'm surprised she speaks English as well as she does, I mean, considering that for half her life she spoke only Japanese.\n\n\"Morning, Mimi!\" I replied.\n\nMimi was fixing breakfast. (She was not, however, the person who'd been yelling about the coffee earlier. That was my father. Every morning, he comes downstairs as soon as he stumbles out of bed, and gets the coffee going pronto for himself and Mom. They practically can't see without a little caffeine in their bodies. Mimi and I drink herbal tea.)\n\nI sat down at my place at the kitchen table. A few moments later, Mom joined me, then Janine, and then my father. Mimi served up the scrambled eggs she'd made, and sat down next to me.\n\n\"This is lovely, Mother,\" said my mom to Mimi. \"Honestly, I don't know what we'd do without you.\"\n\n\"Me, neither!\" I added.\n\n\"And I do not know what I would do if I did not have you to take care of,\" said Mimi earnestly.\n\nMimi has been living with us since before I was born. My grandfather, Mimi's husband, died not long after my mom and dad got married.",

          "text": "\"The members of the Baby\u2011sitters Club were all going over to the new home of Kristy Thomas, our club president. She and her mother and brothers had moved there not long ago when her mother got remarried to Watson Brewer, this really nice guy who also happens to be a really rich guy. He lives in a neighborhood where the yards are big enough for swimming pools or tennis courts, and all the houses are set way back from the road. Some of them are hidden by walls or bushes.\n\nUntil she moved, though, Kristy had lived in a regular old house on regular old Bradford Court, next door to her best friend, Mary Anne Spier, who's our club secretary, and across the street from Claudia Kishi, our vice president and my best friend. It was Kristy's idea to start a business doing baby\u2011sitting for the families in our neighborhood, and it worked out really well. The four of us, plus Dawn Schafer, who lives not far away, meet for about a half an hour three afternoons a week in Claudia's bedroom. Our clients phone us looking for baby\u2011sitters and they almost always get one, since they reach five sitters (I should say, five qualified sitters) at once.\n\nWe have a record book with all sorts of information, including our schedules, and Mary Anne keeps track of our jobs and who's available to sit when, and things like that. Kristy insists that we also keep the Baby\u2011sitters Club Notebook, in which each of us has to write up every single sitting job we do. Then the book gets passed around so the others can read about what happened. It's pretty useful.\n\nThis summer, our club branched out a little. Last month, July, we did our regular baby\u2011sitting and held a play group. We held it right here in my backyard. The neighborhood kids came over three mornings a week for games and stories and art projects. It worked out really well.\n\nBut July was over. It was the beginning of August. And for the first time since the club began almost a year ago, at the beginning of seventh grade, we baby\u2011sitters were going to be scattered, split up. Before that happened, Kristy wanted to have a get\u2011together. And she wanted to have it at her new house. That was fine with the rest of us. We love Watson's house, even though it makes us a little nervous sometimes.\"\n",

I wanted to be casual enough to have fun, but sophisticated enough to look impressive in case any rich neighbors dropped by. I also wanted to be cool since it felt like it was about 150 degrees outside. I changed my mind six times before I decided on this new pink shirt I got the last time we went back to New York City to visit friends. Big, bright green and yellow birds were splashed all over it. It was gigantic, so it would be cool. I put it on with a pair of baggy shorts, looped a wide green belt around my middle, and hunted up some jewelry\u2014silver bangle bracelets and a pair of silver earrings shaped like bells that actually ring when they dangle back and forth.\n\nI'm working on making Mom and Dad let me get my ears pierced a second time so I can wear two pairs of earrings at once, but so far, no luck. I pretty much grew up in New York\u2014we just moved here to Stoneybrook, Connecticut, a year ago\u2014and I have sort of wild taste. My parents have let me get away with a lot of things fashion-wise, but they draw the line at two earrings in each ear. They said I would look like a pirate, although I, personally, have never seen a pirate with more than exactly one earring. I pointed out that if I did get my ears pierced again, probably no one would mistake me for a pirate, but Mom and Dad failed to see the humor in that.\n\nBeep! Beep!\n\nI heard honking and looked out my window. The Kishis' car was in my driveway. Mr. Kishi was at the wheel; Mimi, Claudia's grandmother, was next to him; and Claudia was in the backseat with Mary Anne Spier.\n\n\"I'll be right there!\" I shouted.\n\nI thundered down the stairs.\"\n",

But Wood Acres could be our house and barn. And the secret passage would be the perfect hiding place. Anyway, listen to this. The second time I went in the passage, I was with Jeff, and he found an Indian-head nickel. You know what that is?\"\n\nMary Anne nodded.\n\n\"I know it wasn't there before. And while we were in the passage, we heard all these weird sounds, moaning and stuff.\"\n\n\"You did?\"\n\n\"Yes. And when we were in again just now, I looked everywhere for the nickel and it wasn't there.\"\n\n\"You didn't take it out of the passage?\"\n\n\"Well, I did. I mean, someone did, but I threw it back.\" I told her about the Trip-Man.\n\n\"Did you put the locks on like he suggested?\" Mary Anne wanted to know.\n\n\"Only on the entrance to my room,\" I said. \"And I only lock it at night. We couldn't figure out a way to lock the trapdoor, so we just set a bale of hay on top of it.\"\n\n\"Anyway,\" I went on, \"the peanut shells weren't in the passage before. They just appeared. And no living person has been in this passage except you, Jeff, and me!\"\n\nMary Anne nodded. Then suddenly she stiffened.\n\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\nWe didn't even have to keep quiet to hear it. The next sound was loud enough to wake the dead.\n\nTHUMP.\n\nIt definitely came from the secret passage.\n\nMary Anne started to scream, but I clapped my hand over her mouth. I didn't want Jared to hear us.\n\nThe thump was followed by another thump, then nothing.\n\nWhen the passage had been quiet for ten entire minutes, I jumped up. \"I'm going back in there!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Not me,\" said Mary Anne. \"See you later.\" But she must have felt guilty because a moment later she added, \"I'll guard the entrance for you.\"\n\nI took my flashlight, marched into the passage, and kept going. At the bottom of the stairs, I screamed. Lying at my feet was a book. It was called Great Dog Tales. It looked about a hundred years old. I had never seen it before in my life.

          "text": "Tuesday\n\nThe Pikes strike again! Today I baby-sat for Nicky, Vanessa, Claire, and Margo. Since just the four of them were there, Mrs. Pike decided she needed only one sitter. Believe me, I could have used ten or twelve more. Vanessa and Margo did something to Claire I will never, ever be able to forget. To top it off, Nicky disappeared. I didn't worry at first, but when he didn't turn up after almost an hour, I got nervous. I'm sure he breaks that two-block rule, but I can't prove it. Anyway, get a load of what the girls did.\n\nOh, boy. Am l glad I wasn't sitting at the Pikes' that day. As it was, I got called in to look for Nicky, but Stacey sure had her hands full with the girls, even before she knew Nicky was gone.\n\nIt started when the mail arrived. Usually, the mail in our neighborhood is delivered just before lunch, but that day it was late. The mail truck pulled up at the Pikes' at about three o'clock in the afternoon.\n\n\"I'll get it!\" cried Vanessa. She tore out the door with Claire and Margo at her heels. Nicky was on the sun porch, alone as usual, reading a book.\n\nStacey took advantage of the quiet to start in on the list of chores Mrs. Pike had left her. (Sometimes, if Mr. and Mrs. Pike are behind with the housework, us baby-sitters pitch in with the laundry and stuff, and then we earn mother's helpers wages, which are better than plain old baby-sitters wages.)\n\nStacey got into the rhythm of folding clean clothes and folded two basketsful. Then she moved on to the kitchen, where she unloaded the clean dishes in the dishwasher and loaded up the dirty ones.\n\nThe house was quiet. Stacey sighed contentedly. She checked on Nicky. He was still reading on the porch. She thought she remembered hearing the girls come in.\n\n\"Vanessa?\" she called. \"Claire? Margo?\"\n\n\"We're upstairs!\" Vanessa shouted back.\n\n\"Okay!\"\n\nStacey returned to her chores.\n\nFifteen minutes later, things were still quiet. Quiet wasn't unusual for Nicky those days, but it was for the girls. Three girls generally make some sort of noise, but Stacey hadn't heard so much as a giggle.\n\nShe started up the stairs \u2014 and that was when the thing came flying down at her. It was little and shrieked and had a head of white foam. When it collided with Stacey, it left foam all over her Hawaiian shirt.\n\n\"Yikes!\" cried Stacey. She backed against the wall.\n\nThe foam-thing was rubbing at its eyes. It stumbled forward and Stacey caught it before it fell down the stairs.\n\n\"Claire!\" Stacey exclaimed. \"Is that you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" wailed the foam-thing. \"It's (gulp) meeeeeee!\"\n\nStacey glanced at the top of the stairs. Margo and Vanessa were standing there solemnly, looking down at their little sister. Stacey said later that that's when she first thought something was really wrong. If the older girls had pulled some sort of prank, they would have been laughing hysterically at the sight of the foam. But they were as somber and silent as rocks.\n\n\"Margo? Vanessa?\" Stacey said. She steadied Claire and began to lead her upstairs.\n\n\"It's not our fault!\" Margo cried. \"Really.\"\n\n\"Honest,\" added Vanessa, wide-eyed. \"Don't blame us.\" She was so upset, she forgot to rhyme her words.\n\nStacey made a huge effort to control her temper. \"What happened?\" she asked.\n\nNobody said a word.\n\n\"Claire?\" Stacey peered into Claire's face, wiping away some foam.\n\n\"Shampoo,\" Claire managed to reply.\n\n\"Shampoo? Is that all?\" said Stacey, suddenly feeling better. \"You guys tried to give your sister a shampoo? Well, what's wrong with that? It was very thoughtful. I just wish you'd asked me first. Come on, Claire. All we have to do is wash it out.\"\n\nStill the girls remained quiet. Stacey noticed that the foam was unlike any she'd",

Cabbage, blood, people who chew with their mouths open, and squirrels are a few of them. But snobs are way up there on the list.\n\nThis is unfortunate since I have moved to a wealthy neighborhood here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, recently, and it is overrun with snobs. What happened was that my mom, who used to be divorced, got remarried to Watson Brewer, this rich guy. Since my mom had a little house for the six of us (Mom, me, my three brothers, and our dog, Louie), and Watson had this mansion all to himself (his two kids only live with him every other weekend), it made more sense for us Thomases to move in with Watson than for him to move in with us.\n\nSo we did.\n\nWatson's house is so big that my brothers and I, and Karen and Andrew (our stepsister and stepbrother, who live with us every other weekend), each have a room of our own. Mom and Watson share a room, of course, but their \"room\" is really a suite about the size of a landing field.\n\nAnyway, to get back to the snobs \u2014 I'm surrounded. They're everywhere in Watson's neighborhood. The teenagers around here get their own cars (fancy ones) as soon as they're able to drive. They spin along with the radios blaring, looking fresh and sophisticated. I am so glad my big brothers, Sam and Charlie, aren't like that. Charlie can drive now, but the only thing he drives is Mom's beat-up station wagon. And my brothers and I still go to public school, not to snobby private schools. Guess what most families on our street have: (a) a swimming pool (b) tennis courts (c) a cook named Agnes (d) all of the above. The answer is (d) all of the above.\n\nSo far, Watson has (e) none of the above, which is one of the things I'm learning to like about him. However, he's been talking about putting in a pool, now that Karen and Andrew are older, so we'll see.\n\nI've hardly gotten to know any of the kids here. When we first moved into Watson's house it was summertime, the beginning of July. Most of the kids my age had been sent to fancy camps for the summer. (I would kill Mom if she ever did that to me.) Plus, I'm president of a group called the Baby-sitters Club. All my friends are in the club, and they live way across town \u2014 where I used to live \u2014 so I spent a lot of time with them over in my old neighborhood last summer. What I'm trying to say is that school had started again before I met any of the kids on my street.",

I rolled over and tried to ignore it.\n\n\"Please, please be quiet,\" I mumbled.\n\nBut the clock didn't obey. It went right on buzzing.\n\n\"Oh, all right, you win,\" I told it.\n\nI reached over and shut it off, then sat up, rubbing my eyes.\n\n\"Louie!\" I exclaimed. Our old collie was stretched across the foot of my big bed. Louie mostly sleeps with David Michael, but lately, he's been taking turns sleeping with all of us, even Karen and Andrew on the weekends they visit. I thought it was nice of Louie to share himself.\n\n\"You are such a good dog,\" I whispered, leaning over to him. I stroked the top of his head between his ears. The fur there is almost as soft as rabbit fur. Then I took one of his paws in my hand.\n\n\"Oh, your pads are cold,\" I told him, rubbing the pink pads on the bottom of his paw. \"It must be getting chilly at night. Poor old Louie.\"\n\nLouie licked my hand and gave me a doggie smile.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said.\n\nI got up and looked through my closet, as if I had a really big decision to make about what to wear. Ever since school began I've been wearing the same kind of outfit almost every day \u2014 a turtleneck, a sweater, jeans, and sneakers. I don't care about clothes the way my friends Claudia and Stacey do. They always look really cool and put-together.",

(David Michael, my seven-year-old brother, is a slowpoke. He's always the last one down.)\n\nHere's another thing about Watson that's not so bad. He helps out around the house \u2014 with the cooking, cleaning, gardening, everything. I guess this comes from being divorced and having lived alone for a while before he met Mom. He and Mom share the workload equally. They both have jobs, they both prepare meals (Watson is actually a better cook than Mom is), they both run errands, etc. Twice a week, a cleaning lady comes in, and my brothers and I are responsible for certain chores, but basically Mom and Watson run the show.\n\nSo I wasn't surprised when I stepped into the kitchen that Monday morning to find Mom making coffee and Watson scrambling eggs. Sam was setting the table and Charlie was pouring orange juice. It was a nice familiar scene.\n\n\"Good morning!\" I said.\n\n\"Morning,\" everyone replied.\n\n\"Kristy, can't you wear something different once in a while?\" Sam asked me, eyeing my jeans and sweater.\n\n\"Why do you care what I wear?\" I replied, but I knew perfectly well why he cared. He cared because he was fifteen and girls were practically the only thing on his mind. He thought he was the girl expert of the world, and he was disappointed in my lack of fashion sense. Plus, he was interested in this tr\u00e8s sophisticated girl down the street (one of the private\u2011school girls) and he wanted everything about our family to be up to Monique's standards, which were sky\u2011high.\n\n\"I think Kristy looks lovely,\" said Watson.\n\n\"So do I,\" added Mom, kissing the top of my head.\n\n\"But,\" Watson went on, \"if you ever do want a few, um, new clothes, all you have to do is holler.\"\n\nIt was a nice offer, but leave it to Watson to use a word like \"holler.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said. \"I'll remember that.\"\n\nI absolutely adore Watson's kitchen. Although it has all the modern conveniences and appliances, it looks kind of like an old country kitchen. We eat at a big parson's table with two long",

          "text": "It was the last day of summer vacation. I couldn't believe more than two months had sped by since the end of seventh grade. One day the weather had been fresh and cool with the promise of summer and fun, and now it was stale and hot with the promise of autumn and school. Tomorrow my friends and I would become eighth\u2011graders. An awful lot had happened over the summer. In fact, it had been a more eventful summer than usual. Something important had happened to every single member of the Baby\u2011sitters Club.\n\nI guess that, first of all, I should tell you what the Baby\u2011sitters Club is, in case you don't know. The club consists of me (I'm Mary Anne Spier) and my friends Kristy Thomas, Dawn Schafer, Claudia Kishi, and Stacey McGill. The five of us run a business, which Kristy started. We baby\u2011sit for the kids in our neighborhoods, and we have a lot of fun \u2014 and earn pretty much money, too. We meet three times a week to take calls from people who need baby\u2011sitters, and also sometimes to gossip and fool around. But we're very professional about the way we run our business.\n\nAnyway, here's what happened to us over the summer. I'll start with Kristy, since she's the president of the club, and since her event was the biggest and most exciting of all. Her mother got married again and Kristy was her bridesmaid! Honest. She wore a long dress and her first pair of shoes with heels. Claudia and Dawn and Stacey and I were guests at the wedding. And then Kristy and her family (her two older brothers Sam and Charlie, and her little brother David Michael) moved out of their old house, which was next door to mine, and across town to her stepfather's mansion. Kristy's really got a good deal in her new place \u2014 she has anything she wants (within reason) plus built\u2011in baby\u2011sitting charges. Andrew and Karen, her little stepbrother and stepsister, spend every other weekend (and some in\u2011between time, too) at Watson's. Watson is Kristy's stepfather.\n\nThen there's Claudia Kishi. Claudia is the vice president of our club. We always hold our meetings in her room, since she has her own phone and even her own private phone number. Claudia's summer event was the saddest of all, but it has a happy ending. Her grandmother Mimi (who lives with the Kishis, and who's a favorite of the Baby\u2011sitters Club) had a stroke one night in July. She had to stay in the hospital for a long time and she still has to have physical therapy, but she's getting better. She can walk and talk, and someday (maybe) she'll be able to use her right hand a little more.\n\nDawn Schafer is my new best friend. She's the official alternate officer of the club, which means she can take over the duties of anyone who has to miss a meeting. Her family used to live in California, but her parents got divorced, so her mother moved Dawn and her younger brother Jeff all the way across country to Stoneybrook, Connecticut. Claudia and Kristy and I grew up here, but New England has been kind of an adjustment for Dawn. Anyway, over the summer, Dawn and Jeff got to fly to California to visit their father, and (after they'd come back) Dawn discovered a secret passage in the old farmhouse she lives in!\n\nThe fourth member of the club is Stacey McGill. She's our treasurer, and also sort of a newcomer to Stoneybrook. She moved here exactly one year ago from big, glamorous, exciting New York City. Stacey, by the way, is sort of glamorous and exciting herself. That's why she and Claudia are best friends. They\u2019re both sophisticated and love wearing flashy clothes and weird jewelry and doing things to their hair. The two of them really stand out in a crowd, and I've always been envious of them.\n\nAnyway, Stacey's summer excitement was mine, too. We got jobs as mother's helpers with one of the families we sit for and went with them to the beach \u2014 Sea City, New Jersey. We stayed in Sea City for two weeks and not only had a great time, but found boys we liked! I guess that wasn't such a big deal for Stacey, but it was a big deal for me. I'm kind of shy and tend to be on the quiet side. I'd never been very interested in boys, either. This wasn't because I didn't like them; it was because I was afraid of them. I used to think, What do you say to a boy? Then I realized you can talk to a boy the same way you talk to a girl. You just have to choose your topics more carefully. Obviously, with a boy, you can't talk about bras or cute guys you see on TV, but you can talk about school and movies and animals and sports (if you know anything about sports).\n\nWhen Stacey and I were in Sea City, Stacey started out by being a real pain. She fell in luv (as she always writes it) with this gorgeous lifeguard who was years too old for her, and left me on my own. With no one my age around, I started talking to this nice\u2011looking boy who was hanging around on the beach because he was a mother's helper, too. We really hit it off. We talked about lots of things, and by the time I had to leave Sea City, we had exchanged rings with our initials on them. We bought them on the boardwalk. I don't know if we'll really write to each other (as we promised), but it's nice to know boys aren't aliens from the planet Snorzak or something.",

It was almost time for our last Baby\u2011sitters Club meeting of the summer.\n\n\"Coming!\" I called.\n\nI ran out of my bedroom, down the stairs, and through the hall to the front door. I peeped through the window. Dawn was standing on the steps. She sometimes comes to my house before a meeting, and then we walk over to Claudia's together.\n\n\"Hi!\" she greeted me. Dawn was fussing with her hair. She has the longest hair of anyone I know. It's even longer than Claudia's. And it's pale, pale blonde. Dawn was wearing a pretty snappy outfit \u2014 hot\u2011pink shorts with a big, breezy island\u2011print shirt over a white tank top.\n\n\"Hi,\" I replied. \"You look really terrific.

Cabbage, blood, people who chew with their mouths open, and squirrels are a few of them. But snobs are way up there on the list.\n\nThis is unfortunate since I have moved to a wealthy neighborhood here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, recently, and it is overrun with snobs. What happened was that my mom, who used to be divorced, got remarried to Watson Brewer, this rich guy. Since my mom had a little house for the six of us (Mom, me, my three brothers, and our dog, Louie), and Watson had this mansion all to himself (his two kids only live with him every other weekend), it made more sense for us Thomases to move in with Watson than for him to move in with us.\n\nSo we did.\n\nWatson\u2019s house is so big that my brothers and I, and Karen and Andrew (our stepsister and stepbrother, who live with us every other weekend), each have a room of our own. Mom and Watson share a room, of course, but their \u201croom\u201d is really a suite about the size of a landing field.\n\nAnyway, to get back to the snobs \u2014 I\u2019m surrounded. They\u2019re everywhere in Watson\u2019s neighborhood. The teenagers around here get their own cars (fancy ones) as soon as they\u2019re able to drive. They spin along with the radios blaring, looking fresh and sophisticated. I am so glad my big brothers, Sam and Charlie, aren\u2019t like that. Charlie can drive now, but the only thing he drives is Mom\u2019s beat\u2011up station wagon. And my brothers and I still go to public school, not to snobby private schools. Guess what most families on our street have: (a) a swimming pool (b) tennis courts (c) a cook named Agnes (d) all of the above. The answer is (d) all of the above.\n\nSo far, Watson has (e) none of the above, which is one of the things I\u2019m learning to like about him. However, he\u2019s been talking about putting in a pool, now that Karen and Andrew are older, so we\u2019ll see.\n\nI\u2019ve hardly gotten to know any of the kids here.",

          "text": "My first encounter with the snobby kids was on a Monday morning. My alarm clock went off at 6:45 as usual. I rolled over and tried to ignore it.\n\n\u201cPlease, please be quiet,\u201d I mumbled.\n\nBut the clock didn\u2019t obey. It went right on buzzing.\n\n\u201cOh, all right, you win,\u201d I told it.\n\nI reached over and shut it off, then sat up, rubbing my eyes.\n\n\u201cLouie!\u201d I exclaimed. Our old collie was stretched across the foot of my big bed. Louie mostly sleeps with David Michael, but lately, he\u2019s been taking turns sleeping with all of us, even Karen and Andrew on the weekends they visit. I thought it was nice of Louie to share himself.\n\n\u201cYou are such a good dog,\u201d I whispered, leaning over to him. I stroked the top of his head between his ears. The fur there is almost as soft as rabbit fur. Then I took one of his paws in my hand.\n\n\u201cOh, your pads are cold,\u201d I told him, rubbing the pink pads on the bottom of his paw. \u201cIt must be getting chilly at night. Poor old Louie.\u201d\n\nLouie licked my hand and gave me a doggie smile.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said.\n\nI got up and looked through my closet, as if I had a really big decision to make about what to wear. Ever since school began I\u2019ve been wearing the same kind of outfit almost every day \u2014 a turtleneck, a sweater, jeans, and sneakers. I don\u2019t care about clothes the way my friends Claudia and Stacey do. They always look really cool and put\u2011together.\n\nAfter I was washed and dressed, I ran down the wide staircase to the first floor and into the kitchen. Mom and Watson were with Sam and Charlie. (David Michael, my seven\u2011year\u2011old brother, is a slowpoke. He\u2019s always the last one down.)\n\nHere\u2019s another thing about Watson that\u2019s not so bad. He helps out around the house \u2014 with the cooking, cleaning, gardening, everything. I guess this comes from being divorced and having lived alone for a while before he met Mom. He and Mom share the workload equally. They both have jobs, they both prepare meals (Watson is actually a better cook than Mom is), they both run errands, etc. Twice a week, a cleaning lady comes in, and my brothers and I are responsible for certain chores, but basically Mom and Watson run the show.\n\nSo I wasn\u2019t surprised when I stepped into the kitchen that Monday morning to find Mom making coffee and Watson scrambling eggs. Sam was setting the table and Charlie was pouring orange juice. It was a nice familiar scene.\n\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d everyone replied.\n\n\u201cKristy, can\u2019t you wear something different once in a while?\u201d Sam asked me, eyeing my jeans and sweater.\n\n\u201cWhy do you care what I wear?\u201d I replied, but I knew perfectly well why he cared. He cared because he was fifteen and girls were practically the only thing on his mind. He thought he was the girl expert of the world, and he was disappointed in my lack of fashion sense. Plus, he was interested in this tr\u00e8s sophisticated girl down the street (one of the private\u2011school girls) and he wanted everything about our family to be up to Monique\u2019s standards, which were sky\u2011high.\n\n\u201cI think Kristy looks lovely,\u201d said Watson.\n\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d added Mom, kissing the top of my head.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Watson went on, \u201cif you ever do want a few, um, new clothes, all you have to do is holler.\u201d\n\nIt was a nice offer, but leave it to Watson to use a word like \u201choller.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201d\n\nI absolutely adore Watson\u2019s kitchen. Although it has all the modern conveniences and appliances, it looks kind of like an old country kitchen. We eat at a big parson\u2019s table with two long",

This gives us a pretty wide selection of books (and some of them are an awful lot shorter than The Yearling), but the thing is I just don't like to read. Except for Nancy Drew mysteries. They're fun. And I'm a pretty good sleuth.\n\nMrs. Hall was talking about From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler and The Westing Game. Okay, I'll admit it. I hadn't gotten around to reading either one, even though there is a character in Mixed-up Files with my name \u2014 Claudia. In fact, the only Newbery Award-winner I had read so far was this one called Sarah, Plain and Tall. That was because it was just fifty-eight pages long.\n\n\"Claudia?\" said Mrs. Hall.\n\n\"Yes?\" (Was she just trying to get my attention or had she asked me some question?)\n\n\"Can you help us out here?\" (I guess she'd asked a question.) I could feel the blood rising to my face. I looked down at my notebook in which I'd been doodling pictures of some of the kids I baby-sit for. \"Um, with what?\" I replied.\n\nMrs. Hall sighed. \"Claudia Kishi.\" (This was not a good sign. Mrs. Hall hardly ever uses our last names.) \"Would you please pay attention?\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yes,\" I managed to reply.\n\nMrs. Hall shook her head sadly. I wanted to add, \"Sorry for ruining your day,\" because that's just what she looked like \u2014 a person whose day had been ruined. By me! I felt kind of powerful, although I wasn't proud of it. Imagine being able to ruin a grown-up's entire day single-handedly.\n\nMrs. Hall took my boredom pretty hard. \"Class, please close your books and take out a fresh piece of paper. I want to give you a spelling check.\" (\"Check\" is Mrs. Hall's term for \"surprise quiz.\")\n\nThe class groaned. A few kids directed murderous glances at me, as if this whole thing were my fault. Well, I bet I hadn't been the only one watching that fly and doodling in my notebook.\n\n\"The words,\" Mrs. Hall went on, \"will be taken from chapters seven and eight of Mixed-up Files, which you should have read last night.\"\n\n\"Should have\" is right, I thought.\n\n\"The first word,\" Mrs. Hall said, \"is 'pharaoh.'\"\n\nI waited for her to use it in a sentence (not that it would do me any good). Mrs. Hall always uses spelling words in sentences, and she pronounces the sentences very carefully, with lots of emphasis.\n\n\"The children are studying a famous Egyptian pha-raoh.\"\n\nAh-ha! I thought. Mrs. Hall was giving us a hidden clue. She used famous and pharaoh in the same sentence. They must begin with the same letter. Now, I'm a terrible speller, but I do know that famous begins with an f. Very slowly, I printed f-a-r-o on my paper. Then, thoughtfully, I erased the o and added another r. At the last moment, I tacked a w onto the end. That looked pretty good. Farrow. I was proud of myself for thinking to add one of those killer silent letters to the word. Who invented them, anyway? They're such a waste.\n\n\"'Institute,'\" Mrs. Hall went on.\n\nI barely heard her. Outside the window, our varsity cheerleaders were practicing for our upcoming game against Stamford Junior High. They were really good. I wished I could do a split. Then I remembered what I was supposed to be doing, and scribbled instatute on my paper. Not a moment too soon.\n\n\"'Quarterly.'\"\n\nBefore Mrs. Hall could use quarterly in one of her emphatic sentences, the door to our classroom opened. Every single head, including Mrs. Hall's, swiveled toward it. When we saw Ms. Downey, the school secretary, standing there, we grew really interested. The secretary only comes to a classroom for something major, otherwise the principal sends a student messenger.\n\nMrs. Hall crossed the room to Ms. Downey, and the two of them put their heads together and whispered for a moment. I hate when grownups do that. Then they pulled apart, and Ms. Downey stepped back and showed someone else into the room. Mrs. Hall greeted her warmly. \"Hello, Ashley,\" she said, smiling. \"We're happy to have you.\"\n\nThen Ms. Downey handed Mrs. Hall some papers and left.",

The club is really a sitting business that I run with four of my friends.\n\n'Stacey! Stacey!' someone called.\n\nI turned around, trying to open my locker at the same time. 'Oh, hi, Claud!' I replied.\n\nClaudia Kishi is my best friend here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. (I have another best friend, Laine Cummings, in New York City, which is where I used to live.)

I'm supposed to be at her house by three.... What did you hear?'\n\n'That Howie Johnson asked Dorianne Wallingford to go to the library with him this afternoon.'\n\nI frowned. Howie wasn't exactly my boyfriend. In fact, he wasn't my boyfriend at all. But he had taken me to the last few school dances. So why was he asking Dori to study with him?\n\n'Maybe they're doing a group project together or something,' I suggested. But I was far more hurt than I let on, even though there was no reason to feel that way.\n\n'Yeah. That must be it.' Claudia slipped her arm comfortingly across my shoulders. 'Come on. I'll walk you to Charlotte's. And then I'll see you at the club meeting later.'\n\nClaudia left me at the Johanssens' driveway.

As soon as Dr. Johanssen left, Charlotte began talking again. Sometimes I just couldn't over how she had changed since I first baby-sat for her. That was a year ago, when she was seven. She was quiet then, and sad, and had no friends her age. Now she's happy and friendly and has a new best girlfriend each week. Her mother says half the change is due to the fact that Charlotte wasn't being challenged enough at school and needed to skip a grade (which she did) \u2014 and the other half is due to me! According to Dr. Johanssen, I helped Charlotte learn a lot about herself and about getting along with kids. That makes me feel terrific. Also, it's kind of nice to be somebody's favorite person.

(Kristy is full of ideas.) The sign of a good businessperson, my dad always says, is the ability to recognize a problem and find a way to solve it (a money-making way to solve it, that is). And that's exactly what Kristy did a year ago. She saw what a hard time her mother was having trying to find a sitter for her little brother, David Michael. Her mom had to make one call after another, looking for someone who was free. What Kristy thought was, wouldn't it be great if her mom could find a sitter with just one phone call? And now our club provides that service. When somebody calls Claudia's number on a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday afternoon between 5:30 and 6:00, they reach Claudia (of course), Kristy, Mary Anne Spier, Dawn Schafer, and me, Stacey McGill.\n\nWe are the members of the Baby-sitters Club.\n\nAs I've said, Kristy is the president and Claudia is the vice president.

          "text": "Spectacles. Eyeglasses. Bifocals. Trifocals. No matter what you call them, glasses are glasses, and I have to wear them.\n\nHello. I'm Mallory Pike. I'm eleven. Apart from the glasses, this is the thing you need to know about me: I have seven younger brothers and sisters. That's right, seven. And three of them are triplets, identical boys. If you think it's easy to blend in when you come from an eight-kid family, wear glasses, and furthermore are the only one you know with a head of curly hair, you're wrong.\n\nThe triplets are ten years old. Their names are Adam, Jordan, and Byron. Occasionally, they make me crazy, but mostly they're all right. The good thing about triplets is that they always have each other. Built-in friends.\n\nThe next kid in my family is Vanessa. Vanessa is nine and hopes to become a poet. Sometimes she goes around for days on end speaking in rhyme. Talk about making me crazy. But Vanessa is all right, too, and in a lot of ways we're very much alike.\n\nMy eight-year-old brother is Nicky. I feel kind of sorry for Nicky because he has trouble making a place for himself in our family. He wants to play with the triplets most of the time, since they're boys, but the triplets think Nicky is a baby. That leaves Nicky with us girls, and Nicky is going through this phase where he hates girls.\n\nMargo is seven. She's going through a bossy phase, even though she's almost the youngest in the family. She bosses everyone and everything, even my parents, her dolls, and Pow, this dog that lives down the street. It's always \"Do this,\" and \"Do that.\" Mostly, we ignore her. I mean we ignore the bossiness, not Margo herself.\n\nLast in our family is Claire. Claire is five. I guess being the baby in a big family isn't always easy, but you'd think she wouldn't exactly need to draw attention to herself. That's just what Claire does, though, by being extremely silly. Over the summer, she started calling our parents Moozie and Daggles instead of Mommy and Daddy, and she attaches \"silly-billy-goo-goo\" to people's names. Like, if she wants a drink, she'll say, \"Can I have some juice, Mallory-silly-billy-goo-goo?\" Sometimes she'll add, \"Puh-lease, puh-lease, with a cherry on top?\" It's annoying, but at least she doesn't do it as often as she used to. Besides, Claire is huggable and affectionate, so it's easy to overlook the \"silly-billy-goo-goo\" stuff.\n\nThen there are my parents. My mom doesn't have a job. I mean, a job outside of the house, like being a doctor or an insurance salesperson or something. She says us kids are her job, and that with eight of us it's a big job.\n\nMy dad is a lawyer, but not the kind you see on TV, making wild speeches in a crowded courtroom. He's what's called a corporate lawyer. He's the lawyer for a big company in Stamford, Connecticut. (We live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, which isn't far away.) Mostly, he sits at a desk or attends meetings. Once in awhile, though, he does go to court, but I bet he doesn't make speeches. I think he just stands up a lot and says, \"Objection!\" and things like that.\n\nEvery single one of us Pikes, even my parents, has dark brown hair (Mom calls it \"chestnut brown\" to make it seem less ordinary) and blue eyes. Nicky and Vanessa and I wear glasses (all the time \u2014 not just for reading, unfortunately), but as I mentioned earlier, I am the only one with curly hair. I'm also the only one with freckles across my nose. I really stick out. If only Mom would let me get contacts. But she won't. Not until I'm fifteen. And she won't let me get my ears pierced until I'm thirteen.\n\nBeing eleven is a real trial.\n\nI will admit one thing, though: No matter what age you are, being the oldest of eight kids sure teaches you responsibility. And it taught me a lot about baby-sitting. I love sitting, even though I haven't done much of it on my own yet. But guess what? These girls I know asked me if I'd be interested in joining their baby-sitting club! And they're not just any girls, they're older girls! No kidding. There are four of them and they live in my neighborhood. (Well, most of them do.) Their names are Kristy Thomas, Claudia Kishi, Mary Anne Spier, and Dawn Schafer. They used to have a fifth member, Stacey McGill, but she moved away. That's why the girls need me \u2014 to take Stacey's place. The way they know me is that they sit for our family all the time. Although lately, instead of being sat for, I've helped with the sitting. And as I said, I know a lot about kids.\n\nI am so flattered that the girls want me to join their club. But I'm nervous, too. What if they decide I'm not good enough or not grown-up enough or something? Oh, well. I'll know on Monday. That's when I go to my first club meeting.\n\nRight now it's Saturday. Two days to wait. But I've got plenty to do. I'm reading three books \u2014 Dr. Dolittle, The Incredible Journey, and this really funny one called Freaky Friday. I love to read, and I don't believe that you have to finish one book before you start another. I like to write, too. I keep journals, and I write stories, stories, stories. Sometimes I illustrate them.\n\nPlus, this afternoon, I have to baby-sit. In fact, I better go downstairs now. Dad is taking the triplets to the barber for haircuts, and Mom is taking Margo and Vanessa shopping for sneakers. That leaves me in charge of Nicky and Claire. I guess I'm lucky that my parents pay me for taking care of my own brothers and sisters.",

She and Mary Anne used to do a lot of baby\u2011sitting in their neighborhood, and Kristy realized that any time a parent needed a sitter, he or she had to make about a zillion phone calls trying to find someone who was free. She thought, \"Wouldn't it be great if a parent could make one call and reach a whole bunch of sitters at once?\" So she got a group of friends together to form the club, and now we meet three times a week \u2014 Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons from 5:30 until 6:00. Our clients know about our meetings (we advertise), and they call us while we're holding them. There are six members of the club now, and usually at least one of us is free and can take any job that comes in. Great for the parent (only one call to make, plus we are responsible, trustworthy sitters). And great for us (we each get lots of jobs, have fun, and earn money).\n\nWe run our club very professionally. We sitters are always on time, we make sure we know important information, such as where the parents will be and when the children should go to bed, and we're just plain great with kids. We love them! We have a club record book in which Mary Anne keeps track of our clients and appointments (she's the secretary), and I keep track of the money we earn (I'm the treasurer). We also have a club notebook, which is like a diary. (Kristy makes us keep it up\u2011to\u2011date.) In it, we each write up every job we go on, and then we're supposed to read the entries about once a week. That way, we know what's going on with the kids the other club members have taken care of.",

As she says, her mouth gets her in trouble sometimes. When Kristy first started the club she lived right across the street from Claudia and next door to Mary Anne. She and Mary Anne had been best friends all their lives. Then last summer Kristy's mom, who had been divorced, married Watson Brewer, a really rich guy. Watson moved Kristy and her family across town to his mansion. Kristy has three brothers \u2014 Charlie, who's seventeen; Sam, who's fifteen; and David Michael, who's just seven. Now she also has a stepsister and stepbrother. They're Watson's kids. Karen is six and Andrew is four. Kristy likes her new family, but it represents a big change for her and she has a lot to get used to. Luckily, Charlie drives her to and from club meetings (we pay him out of the dues money we put in our treasury each week), so Kristy doesn't have to miss out on anything just because she moved.",

Kristy couldn't care less about clothes; Claudia is a fashion nut who is always wearing the latest fad thing and looks great. She's Japanese\u2011American and has this long, silky, jet\u2011black hair; dark, almond\u2011shaped eyes; and a creamy, clear complexion. She loves art and reading mysteries, but she's not a very good student. Which is too bad because her older sister, Janine, is a genius.

Kristy thinks boys were put on this planet to torture her, Mary Anne is the only one of us with a steady boyfriend. (Her boyfriend, by the way, is Logan Bruno, one of our club's associate members. That means that Logan is someone we can call on if a job comes in that none of us is free to take. Our other associate member is a girl named Shannon Kilbourne, who lives across the street from Kristy.) Although Mary Anne didn't used to care about clothes, lately she's been taking more of an interest in them and she's been looking good. One thing about the two best friends that's the same is their appearance. They're both small for their age and have brown hair and brown eyes. Mary Anne lives with her dad and her kitten, Tigger.

My family and I had only been living in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, for a few weeks at that time....\n\nI woke up before my alarm went off. I've always been able to do that. But for some reason, I always set it anyway. Just in case I should have a mental lapse and not wake up on time. The reason I get up early is so that I can practice my ballet.\n\nEvery morning, I wake up at 5:29, hit the alarm before it can off and wake everyone else up, chuck my nightgown, and put on my leotard and warm\u2011up stuff. Then I tiptoe down to the basement. No matter how quiet I am, I know Mama always wakes up and listens to me make my way to the basement. That's just the kind of mother she is. I hope she goes back to sleep after she sees that everything is as it should be. But I'll probably never know. Even though she and I are very close (which is how I know she wakes up when I do), I'll probably never ask if she goes back to sleep, and she probably doesn't know that I know she wakes up. It's not the kind of thing you need to talk about.",

          "text": "The barre in the basement is one of the nice things about moving to Stoneybrook. As I mentioned earlier, we haven't lived here very long. In fact, until we moved, we had lived in a little house on a little street in Oakley, New Jersey. I was born there. Well, not in the house \u2014 in Oakley General Hospital \u2014 but my parents were already living in the house.\n\nMaybe I should tell you a little about my family now. (I'll get back to the barre in the basement in Stoneybrook. Really, I will.) Here are the people in my family: Mama; Daddy; my eight\u2011year\u2011old sister, Becca (short for Rebecca); my baby brother, Squirt (whose real name is John Philip Ramsey, Jr.); and me \u2014 Jessi Ramsey. I'm eleven, and my full name is Jessica Davis Ramsey.\n\nMy family is black.\n\nI know it sounds funny to announce it like that. If we were white, I wouldn't have to, because you would probably assume we were white. But when you're a minority, things are different.\n\nOf course, if you could see me, there wouldn't be any question that I'm black. I have skin the color of cocoa \u2014 darkish cocoa \u2014 soft black hair, and eyes like two pieces of coal. That's how dark brown they are. They're the darkest brown eyes I have ever seen. My sister Becca looks like a miniature version of me, except that her eyes aren't quite as dark. Also, she doesn't have my long, long legs. Maybe that's why she's not a dancer. (Or maybe it's because of her stage fright.) And Squirt looks like, well, a baby. That's really all you can say about him. He's only fourteen months old. (By the way, he got his nickname from the nurses in Oakley General because he was the smallest baby in the hospital. Even now, he's a little on the small side, but he makes up for it by being extremely bright.)\n\nAs I said, we used to live in Oakley. I liked Oakley a lot. In our neighborhood were both black families and white families. (Our street was all black.) And Oakley Elementary was mixed black and white. So was my dancing school. My grandparents and a whole bunch of my cousins and aunts and uncles lived nearby. (My best friend was my cousin Keisha. We have the same birthday.)\n\nThen Daddy's company said they were going to give him a big raise and a big promotion. That was great, of course. The only thing was that they also wanted to move him to the Stamford, Connecticut, branch of the company. That's how we ended up here in Stoneybrook. The company found this house for us in this little town. My parents like small towns (Oakley is pretty small), and Daddy's drive to Stamford each morning isn't long at all.\n\nBut \u2014 I don't think any of us expected the one bad thing we found in Stoneybrook: There are hardly any black families here. We're the only black family in our neighborhood, and I am \u2014 get this \u2014 the only black kid in the whole entire sixth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. Can you believe it? I can't.\n\nUnfortunately, things have been a little rough for us. I can't tell if some people here really don't like black people, or if they just haven't known many, so they're kind of wary of us. But they sure weren't very nice at first. Things are getting better, though. (Slowly.)\n\nThings started getting better for me when I met Mallory Pike. I think she's going to be my new best friend. (Actually, she is my new best friend, but I feel funny saying that \u2014 like it might hurt Keisha somehow.) Mallory is this really nice girl in my grade who's part of an eight\u2011kid family. And she got me into a group called the Baby\u2011sitters Club, which has been great.",

Our new house is so much bigger than our house in Oakley, and Daddy's job pays so much more money, that he and Mama set up this practice area in the basement for me. It's got mirrors, and a couple of mats (for warm\u2011ups), and of course, the barre.\n\nOn the morning I've been telling you about, I practiced in the basement until I heard Mama and Daddy making coffee in the kitchen.

Claudia and I had just been starting to talk about my visiting Stoneybrook for a weekend, when something happened.\n\nThe something was Judy.\n\nI don't know Judy's last name. She's the homeless woman who lives on our block. (Some people call her a bag lady.) Now I bet you're wondering about something. You've heard me mention a roach in my bedroom and a bag lady on my block. Just where in New York do I live? you're probably asking yourself. Well, I live in a very nice neighborhood on the Upper West Side. As I said before, New York roaches live everywhere \u2014 and lately, so do homeless people. Homelessness is a serious problem in New York. There are thousands and thousands of people like Judy. Some of them live in shelters or welfare hotels, some live in subway stations or railroad stations, and some actually live on the street. Judy is one of the ones who actually live on the street. She sleeps in doorways or on top of grates where warm air blows up from the subway. She gets her food from garbage cans or begs for handouts.\n\nIt is not a nice life.\n\nI see Judy at least twice a day (when I go back and forth between my nice, comfortable, doorman apartment building and my nice, comfortable private school), and I have an idea of what her life is like. Although I'm sure you can't completely understand homelessness until you've experienced it.\n\nWhat I see when I see Judy is a woman who looks a lot older than she really is. (She looks about a hundred, but Dad says she's only forty\u2011two. I don't know how he knows this.) I see a woman who owns so few things that she won't part with any of them. And I mean, she hangs onto empty tin cans, bottle caps, newspapers, and used plastic cups. She carries her stuff around in old, wrinkled, falling\u2011apart shopping bags. She's a walking dump \u2014 but that stuff we'd call trash is her life. I see a woman who is almost always hungry, who has huge sores on her legs, whose hair is matted, and whose face and hands are permanently red from being exposed to the sun, wind, heat, and cold.\n\nJudy and I couldn't be more different. Yet we're friends. Well, sort of. When Judy is in a good mood, we smile and say hello to each other. Judy calls me Missy. When she's not in a good mood, which is often \u2014 watch out! Judy will stand on the sidewalk and just shout stuff for hours. She screams and yells, then finally she quiets down and mumbles crossly. When she's in those moods, she doesn't call me Missy. She doesn't call me anything. I don't think she even recognizes me.\n\nSo what does Judy have to do with my friends' visit to New York? Well, it's like this: The people on our block who see and hear Judy everyday began to get worried about her. They decided that it was time for them, plain old ordinary citizens, to see what they could do to help Judy and other homeless people in the neighborhood. So they organized a big meeting that was to be held for an entire Saturday afternoon. Most of the adults in my building (including Mom and Dad) were eager to go. Which means that a lo",

I don't love English, but I hate math and science\n\n\"Why not get bad work done first, then do English?\" suggested Mimi.\n\nI screwed up my face. \"Okay,\" I agreed.\n\nWe began with the math. I don't know what it is about numbers. They just don't make sense to me. Stacey once said that she can \"read\" numbers the way she can read words. She understands them. She can look at a problem for a few moments, and suddenly she has the answer, without doing any figuring or writing. She calculates things in her head as if her brain were a computer.\n\nNot me. Oh, no. I sit and figure, and half the time I'm figuring wrong. Adding when I should be multiplying, subtracting four from ten and getting seven. What a mess!\n\nMimi and I plodded through my work. Mimi is so patient. She never raises her voice or gets aggravated.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, when I had finished my math and science, \"where are English plobrems, my Claudia?\"\n\nI knew she had meant to say \"problems.\" \"They're just some questions,\" I told her, \"and they're right here.\"\n\nIn English class this year we're reading the Newbery Award-winning books. We've already read several. Now we're reading Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry. I didn't think I would like it, but really, it isn't bad.\n\nMimi looked at the list of questions and read the first one. \"In what \u2014 in what ways is main \u2014 is the main character in Roll of, um, Thunder, Hear My Cry simi \u2014 similar to main \u2014 to the main character in A Wrinkle in Time?\"\n\n\"Oh, lord,\" I replied, \"They couldn't be more different! I hate questions like that.\"\n\n\"Think, my Claudia. Is anything the same about them?\"\n\n\"They're both girls,\" I said.\n\nIf Janine had been helping me, she probably would have thrown down her pencil in disgust at that answer, but Mimi just said, \"That a good start. What else?\"\n\nWe worked and worked. The more we talked, the more answers I found. When we were finally done, I kissed Mimi, thanked her, and escaped to my room.",

After awhile, I opened my box of pastels and slowly set to work. When I'm in the middle of a good project, especially a painting or a drawing, I can forget about everything else. Which is what I did. And which may explain why I jumped a mile when the phone rang.\n\n\"Hello?\" I said.\n\n\"Hi, Claudia. It's Ashley.\"\n\nAshley Wyeth is a new friend of mine. We have a funny relationship. It seems like we're always mad at each other. We're forever fighting, then making up. But Ashley is the only person who truly understands my love of art. She's a\u00a0artist herself \u2014 the most talented person our age I know. Before she moved to Stoneybrook, she lived in Chicago and went to this really great art school there. And she thinks I'm talented! Ashley can be a pain in the neck, though, because she's always bugging me to quit baby-sitting and spend more time on my art.\n\nSo when Ashley called, I braced myself for a lecture, but all she wanted was our English assignment. I read her the questions and then hung up. As soon as I did, the phone rang again.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\nAt first there was just silence at the other end of the phone. Then an odd-sounding voice said, \"Do you have Prince Albert in a can?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" I replied. \"Prince Albert?\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind.\" The voice suddenly sounded disgusted and the caller hung up.\n\nI looked at the receiver as if it could explain to me what had just happened. A goof call gone wrong, I decided as I hung up. The caller was probably someone who'd been at the film festival. Practical-joke season had begun \u2014 and I, for one, did not like it.",

She was wearing a very snazzy pair of red pants that were held up by red suspenders. Under the suspenders was a blue-and-white-striped T-shirt. The legs of her pants ended in cuffs, and on her feet were running shoes tied with purple laces.\n\n\"Hi!\" she said cheerfully. \"I'm Betsy.

Karen is six and Andrew is four, and Karen was the one doing the yelling. Andrew is sort of quiet and shy. In fact, he\u2019s very quiet and shy. He\u2019s the opposite of Karen. It\u2019s hard to believe they\u2019re brother and sister.\n\n\u201cHi, you guys!\u201d I called. I was on the upstairs landing, looking down.

One of the most important things to know about me is that I am the president, founder, and creator of a business called the Baby\u2011sitters Club.\n\nDavid Michael is my brother. He\u2019s seven. I have two other brothers. They\u2019re in high school. Sam is fifteen and Charlie is seventeen. Up until not long ago my three brothers and I lived with our mother in a small house across town here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. (Our parents are divorced.) Then my mom met this guy, Watson Brewer, a divorced millionaire. Practically before we knew it, she had married him and he had moved us into his house \u2014 which is a mansion.\n\nKaren and Andrew are Watson\u2019s children. They live with us every other weekend and for two weeks during the summer. The rest of the time they live with their mother and stepfather.\n\nTo be honest, I didn\u2019t like Watson much at first. Oh, all right. I hated him. I didn\u2019t want anything to do with him, even though he likes baseball as much as I do. I even refused to meet his kids. You know what brought us together? The Baby\u2011sitters Club. Once, in an emergency, I got a job sitting for Karen and Andrew. By the time the job was over, I thought they were the greatest kids in the world. Now I am so, so glad they\u2019re my steps.",

He likes to get it out of the way on Fridays so he can turn into a couch potato for the rest of the weekend. Charlie was out, but I was waiting for him to come home. Three times a week he drives me to and from meetings of the Baby\u2011sitters Club, which are held from five\u2011thirty until six o\u2019clock in my old neighborhood on the other side of Stoneybrook.\n\nI decided I better go check on the little kids. I never know what Karen might be up to. She\u2019s not naughty, but she\u2019s fearless and has a wild imagination. (Watson calls it \u201cfertile,\u201d I guess meaning that any idea could grow there.)\n\nTrying to keep track of all the people (not to mention animals) in my house is not easy, especially when Karen and Andrew are over. Can you believe that my mom has been talking about wanting another kid? I can\u2019t. I love children, but there\u2019s plenty of confusion at our house as it is. Besides, my mother is at least thirty\u2011seven.\n\nI found Karen, Andrew, and David Michael in the backyard. They were trying to play three\u2011man softball.\n\n\u201cThis is so dumb!\u201d David Michael was saying. (He was only saying that because he had just missed the ball.)\n\n\u201cDavid\u202fMichael,\u201d I said, \u201cwatch the ball when it\u2019s being pitched. Don\u2019t look at your bat. I know you want to connect the two of them, but believe me, you won\u2019t hit the ball if you don\u2019t look at it.\u201d\n\nKaren pitched the ball again and David\u202fMichael watched it like a hawk. He swung. Crack! The ball sailed across the yard.\n\n\u201cAll right! Home run!\u201d I yelled.\n\nI just love sports.\n\n\u201cBoy, thanks Kristy!\u201d exclaimed my brother.",

Behave yourselves, okay? Sam\u2019s home and Mom and Watson will be here soon. We\u2019ll talk about softball later.\u201d\n\nI ran to our front drive and jumped into the car, next to Charlie.\n\n\u201cReady to go visit your little friends?\u201d he teased me.\n\nI scowled. They are not little friends, and Charlie knows it. They are Claudia Kishi, Mary Anne Spier, Dawn Schafer, Mallory Pike, and Jessi Ramsey, and they are all different and special. And none of them is little. Claudia, Mary Anne, and Dawn are thirteen, like me. Jessi and Mal are eleven and in the sixth grade.\n\nI used to live next door to Mary Anne (she\u2019s my best friend) and across the street from Claudia. Us thirteen\u2011year\u2011olds are eighth\u2011graders in Stoneybrook Middle School. (Most of the kids in my new neighborhood go to private school, but Mom let my brothers and me stay in my regular public schools.)\n\nMary Anne Spier is the most sensitive person I know. Sometimes she\u2019s too sensitive. She\u2019ll cry over the slightest thing. And she\u2019s shy and quiet, like Andrew. But once she\u2019s your friend, you\u2019ve got a friend for life. She is very loyal. Maybe that\u2019s part of the reason Mary Anne was the first one of us to have a steady boyfriend. His name is Logan Bruno. Mary Anne lives with her dad and her kitten, Tigger. Her mom died a long time ago, so long ago that Mary Anne doesn\u2019t even remember her.\n\nEven though I have a big mouth and I\u2019m far from shy, Mary Anne and I are alike in some ways. For one thing, we look alike. We both have brown eyes and brown hair and are short. I\u2019m the shortest kid in our grade, believe it or not, but Mary Anne has grown slightly. For another thing, we don\u2019t care much about c",

          "text": "\"Kindergarten baby, stick your head in gravy! Wash it off with applesauce and show it to the Navy!\" sang Nicky.\n\n\"Mommy, make him stop!\" cried Claire.\n\n\"Nicholas Pike,\" said my mother, \"this is supposed to be fun. We are going to Washington Mall, which you have been begging to do for weeks, and where, I might add, each of you kids is going to get a new pair of shoes. You do want new shoes, don\u2019t you?\"\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Nicky contritely.\n\n\"Then apologize to your sister. She doesn\u2019t like being called a kindergarten baby. You didn\u2019t like it either when you were her age.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Claire,\" said Nicky.\n\nMom didn\u2019t see it, because we were so jam\u2011packed into our car, but Claire\u2019s response was to stick her tongue out at Nicky. So he silently mouthed \"kindergarten baby\" to her and she turned bright red. If I hadn\u2019t grabbed her then, who knows what would have happened?\n\nThere are eight kids in my family. Nicky and Claire are just two of them, but they were having a big enough fight for all of us.\n\nI am Mallory. I\u2019m eleven and the oldest. Claire is five and the youngest. Between Claire and me are Margo, who\u2019s seven, Nicky, who\u2019s eight, Vanessa, who\u2019s nine, and the triplets, who are ten. The triplets are Adam, Byron, and Jordan, and they\u2019re identical. You would hardly know this, though, since they always wear different clothes and have such different personalities.\n\nAfter I grabbed Claire, she calmed down. It was a good thing I was sitting between her and Nicky. I had put myself there on purpose. When it comes to kids \u2014 my brothers and sisters, or any others \u2014 I\u2019m pretty smart. For instance, I had figured out the seating arrangement for our outing to the mall. (It takes awhile to drive there.) I had put Margo in the front seat with Mom and Dad, since she gets carsick sometimes and riding in the front is less bumpy. I had put the triplets in the way back, where they could be jerks without bothering anybody, especially Nicky, whom they are apt to tease mercilessly. And in the backseat, I had put Claire, me, Nicky, and Vanessa, in that order. Sitting between Claire and Nicky, I could break up fights. And with Vanessa by the window, she could daydream or make up poems, lost in her own world, which is how she\u2019s happiest.\n\n\"There\u2019s the mall!\" cried Margo, pointing. She had survived the trip without once saying she was going to barf.\n\n\"All right!\" cried Nicky. \"New shoes. I want sneakers, and they have to be Reeboks. Or Avias. Either one.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are so cool, Nick,\" said Adam sarcastically from the back.\n\n\"Shut up!\"\n\n\"You shut up!\"\n\n\"Mom, Nicky and Adam said \u2018shut up,\u2019\" announced Claire.\n\n\"I heard,\" said Mom dryly. (Poor Mom. Since Dad was driving, she got stuck handling the squabbling and complaining.) \"And all I have to say is this: How badly does any of you want shoes?\"\n\nUs kids \u2018shut up\u2019 right away. We didn\u2019t think Mom would really not buy shoes for us \u2026 but we couldn\u2019t be sure. Long car rides with eight children could drive anyone crazy. (I should point out, by the way, that our mother is not an ogre. She\u2019s just human. And half an hour of kindergarten baby and tattling was wearing on her nerves.)",

We hiked over to a boutique, walked through it, and were in \u2026 the mall.\n\nI swear, the mall is another world. You are surrounded by stores and shops, and even better things: food stands, exhibits, a flower mart, and my personal favorite, the ear\u2011piercing boutique. I hardly know where to look.\n\nAs badly as we wanted new shoes, my brothers and sisters and I also wanted to be turned loose to go exploring.\n\nBut, \u201cShoes first,\u201d said Dad.\n\nSo we went to Antoinette\u2019s Shoe Tree (what on earth is a shoe tree?) and each got what we needed \u2014 not, I might emphasize, what we wanted. For example, what I wanted were these extremely cool pink shoes with green trim. What I got were loafers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re much more practical,\u201d said Mom. \u201cThey go with almost everything you own. And they\u2019ll last at least a year.\u201d\n\nWhen you are a parent of eight children, you have to think of these things. But when you are an eleven\u2011year\u2011old who has to show up in school every day, you just want those cool pink shoes.\n\nAs soon as we\u2019d gotten our shoes, Mom and Dad let us kids split up so we could explore the mall for an hour. We had brought along spending money and were eager to, well, spend it. So the triplets went off by themselves, Nicky went off with Dad, Vanessa went off with Mom, and Claire and Margo begged to come with me.",

It was my sister, Becca, pretending she was a cat.\n\nI patted the top of her head but said, \"Becca, I really have to do my homework.\"\n\n\"Then how come you\u2019re lying on your bed?\" asked Becca, getting to her feet.\n\n\"Because this is a comfortable way to work.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re supposed to sit at your desk.\"\n\nThis is true. My parents believe that homework magically gets done better if you\u2019re sitting up than if you\u2019re lying down.\n\nI sighed. Then I changed the subject, which usually distracts Becca. \"Why are you a cat tonight?\" I asked her.\n\nShe shrugged. \"I\u2019m trying all the animals. It\u2019s fun to pretend.\"\n\nThe night before, Becca had been a dog, the night before that, a horse.\n\n\"Well, kitty, let me finish my work,\" I said.\n\n\"Meow,\" replied Becca, who dropped to her hands and knees and crawled into the hallway.\n\nBecca is eight and has a big imagination. If she weren\u2019t so shy, she\u2019d probably make a really terrific actress, but she has awful stage fright.\n\nI do not have stage fright, which is lucky since I\u2019m a ballet dancer and have to perform in front of audiences all the time.",

I am Jessi Ramsey, and I\u2019m eleven and in sixth grade. \"Jessi\" is short for \"Jessica.\" (And \"Becca\" is short for \"Rebecca,\" as if you couldn\u2019t have guessed.) Becca and I live with our parents and our baby brother, Squirt. Squirt\u2019s real name is John Philip Ramsey, Jr. When he was born, he was so tiny that the nurses in the hospital started calling him Squirt. Now his nickname seems sort of funny. Well, it always has been funny, but it seems especially funny since Squirt, who has just learned to walk, is now the size of most other babies his age.\n\nAnyway, as I said before, I\u2019m a ballet dancer. I\u2019ve been taking dance classes for years. My ballet school is in Stamford, which isn\u2019t too far from Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where my family and I live. We haven\u2019t lived here long, though. We moved to Connecticut from New Jersey just a few months ago when my dad was offered a job he couldn\u2019t turn down.\n\nOh, something else about my family \u2014 we\u2019re black. Actually, that\u2019s much more important than I\u2019m making it sound. You know what? It wasn\u2019t so important when we were living in Oakley, New Jersey. Our old neighborhood was mixed black and white, and so was my ballet school and my regular school. But believe it or not, we are one of the few black families in all of Stoneybrook. In fact, I\u2019m the only black student in my whole grade. When we first moved here, some people weren\u2019t very nice to us. Some were even mean. But things have settled down and are getting better. Becca and I are making friends. Actually, I have a lot more friends than Becca does. There are two reasons for this: one, I\u2019m not shy; two, I belong to the Baby\u2011sitters Club. (More about that later.)\n\nMy mother is wonderful and so is my father. We\u2019re a very close family. Mama, Daddy, Becca, Squirt, and me. No pets. We\u2019ve never had a pet, although Becca apparently wishes we had one. (Sometimes I do, too, for that matter.)",

The club is really a business, a sitting business. It was started by Kristy Thomas, who\u2019s the president. There are six of us in the club. We sit for kids in our neighborhoods, and we get lots of jobs and have lots of fun.\n\nMy best friend in Stoneybrook is Mallory Pike. Mal and I have a lot of classes together at Stoneybrook Middle School. And Mal is the one who got me into the Baby\u2011Sitters Club. The girls needed another member and ended up taking both of us. We were just getting to be friends then \u2014 and now that we\u2019ve been in the club together for awhile, we\u2019re best friends. (I have another best friend in Oakley \u2014 my cousin Keisha.)\n\nAnyway, the people in the club are Mallory, Kristy, me, plus Claudia Kishi, Mary Anne Spier, and Dawn Schafer. Two people who are sort of part of the club but who don\u2019t come to our meetings are our associate members, Logan Bruno and Shannon Kilbourne. (I\u2019ll tell you more about them later.) It\u2019s funny that us six club members work so well together, because boy, are we different. We have different personalities, different tastes, different looks, and different kinds of families.\n\nKristy Thomas, our president, is \u2026well, talk about not shy. Kristy is direct and outgoing. Sometimes she can be loud and bossy. But basically she\u2019s really nice. And she\u2019s always full of ideas. Kristy is thirteen and in eighth grade. (So are all the club members, except Mal and me.) She has this long brown hair and is pretty, but doesn\u2019t pay much attention to her looks. I mean, she never bothers with makeup, and she always wears jeans, a turtleneck, a sweater, and sneakers. Kristy\u2019s family is sort of interesting. Her parents are divorced, and for the longest time, Kristy lived with just her mom, her two older brothers, Sam and Charlie (they\u2019re in high school), and her little brother, David Michael, who\u2019s seven now. But when her mom met this millionaire, Watson Brewer, and got remarried, things sure changed for Kristy. For one thing, Watson moved Kristy\u2019s family into his mansion, which is on the other side of Stoneybrook. Kristy used to live next door to Mary Anne Spier and across the street from Claudia Kishi. Now she\u2019s in a new neighborhood. For another thing, Kristy acquired a little stepsister and stepbrother \u2014 Watson\u2019s children from his first marriage. Karen is six and Andrew is four. Although it took Kristy some time to adjust to her new life, she sure loves Karen and Andrew. They\u2019re among her favorite baby\u2011sitting charges. Kristy\u2019s family has two pets \u2014 an adorable puppy named Shannon and a fat old cat named Boo\u2011Boo.\n\nThe vice\u2011president of the Baby\u2011Sitters Club is Claudia Kishi, and she is totally cool.

So how come I ended up feeling so confused? Believe me, there\u2019s a lot to tell. And I might as well start at the beginning.\n\nFirst off, you\u2019re probably wondering who Sunshine is. Well, that\u2019s me. Of course nobody around here calls me Sunshine. Here in Connecticut they call me by my regular name, Dawn Schafer. But not my dad. He started calling me Sunshine when I was little and, unfortunately, it stuck. Maybe he gave me the name because of my long blonde hair. My hair is so light it\u2019s almost the color of cornsilk, and it reaches all the way past my waist. Or maybe Dad gave me the name because I love the sun so much. I really do. I love warm weather and the beach.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just a California girl at heart. After all, that\u2019s where I came from. And that Sunday, I was getting to go back for a visit!",

          "text": "I got the postcard from Dad when I came home from school that Thursday afternoon. I still had so much to do, so much to get ready. I dragged my suitcase out of the closet, threw it on the bed, and started to lay out my clothes. I decided to bring my white cotton skirt \u2014 I could wear that with anything. And, of course, my bathing suit (a bikini) and my jeans and sneakers. I wasn\u2019t sure about my yellow cotton overalls. And would I really need three sundresses?\n\nMaybe you\u2019re wondering why my dad lives in California and I live in Connecticut. Well, sometimes I wonder, too. Believe me, it\u2019s not the way I would\u2019ve arranged it. But even so, things are working out okay. You see, about a year and a half ago, Mom and Dad got divorced. Dad stayed in our house in California and Mom moved me and my brother, Jeff, here to Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I think Mom wanted to come here because my grandparents live here and it\u2019s the town where she grew up. To tell the truth, at first I wasn\u2019t the happiest, but then I adjusted. I found myself a best friend, Mary Anne Spier, and I got invited to join the Baby-sitters Club, which is just about the most fun club in the whole wide world.\n\nMy brother, Jeff, though, didn\u2019t adjust so easily. In fact, he didn\u2019t adjust at all. He started getting kind of nasty with me and Mom, and he even started to get in fights at school. It was pretty bad. His teacher kept calling up Mom and I don\u2019t think Mom knew what to do. Finally we decided to let Jeff go back to California for awhile. He really just wanted to be back with his friends and live with Dad. I don\u2019t think Mom was thrilled with the idea, but she figured she had to let Jeff try it for six months.\n\nMe, I didn\u2019t like the idea at all. It was bad enough that Mom and Dad had to get divorced. Already our family was split. But when Jeff left Mom and me, too, it felt like Jeff was up and deserting us. And then another part of me thought, hey, why couldn\u2019t I be the one to get to move back to California?\n\nNow I\u2019m kind of used to the idea. In my head I understand all the reasons why things are the way they are. But sometimes it does seem strange the way the family has divided up. Boys against the girls. Or West Coast against the East Coast. I love Mom, and she and I get to stay together, but of course I love Dad and Jeff, and I miss them sometimes. And I know they miss us, too.\n\nBut Mom is the greatest. She and I have gotten a lot closer through all of this and we\u2019ve made a whole new life for ourselves. We live in an old, old farmhouse that was built in 1795. No kidding. The rooms are really small and the doorways are so short that tall people have to stoop to get through them. Mom says people used to be shorter in the 1700s.\n\nThe best thing about our house, though, is that it has a secret trapdoor in our barn that leads into a long, dark tunnel. You need a flashlight to walk through. The tunnel leads up into our house and comes out \u2026 right at the wall to my bedroom! The wall has a special latch that springs open to the touch. Talk about exciting. You should\u2019ve seen the faces on my friends in the Baby-sitters Club when I showed them.",

What it is is just what it says, a club for baby\u2011sitters. It was Kristy Thomas\u2019s great idea. She\u2019s our president. She figured that it would be great if there was a club that all the parents in the neighborhood could use whenever they needed a sitter. That way, they\u2019d be pretty sure of getting someone for the job and they\u2019d only have to make one call. Great for them, and great for us, too, since we\u2019re all super sitters and we love the work. Leave it to Kristy to come up with a good business idea. And leave it to Kristy to organize the whole thing.\n\nWhat we do is this: Three times a week we have meetings in the afternoon. We meet at Claudia\u2019s house because she has a phone in her room \u2026 with her very own number! Claudia is Claudia Kishi and she\u2019s our vice\u2011president. Claudia is about as different from Kristy as you can get. Kristy is kind of small for her age and is a real tomboy. She always wears the same thing \u2014 jeans, a turtle neck, and sneakers. But not Claudia. You can always count on Claudia to be wearing some really unusual outfit, like a white jumpsuit with a wide purple belt and purple high\u2011top sneakers. Claudia\u2019s Japanese\u2011American and she\u2019s got beautiful, long, shiny black hair that she fixes differently practically every day. She loves art, too, so she has a really interesting sense of style.\n\nAfter those two, there\u2019s Mary Anne Spier, our club secretary, and, as I said, she\u2019s my best friend in Stoneybrook. Mary Anne lives alone with her father because her mother died when she was a baby. Her father\u2019s been kind of strict with her and a lot of people think Mary Anne\u2019s quiet. It\u2019s true, she can be shy sometimes. But wouldn\u2019t you know it, she was the first one of us to get a boyfriend!",

          "text": "I\u2019ve been thinking about families lately, wondering what makes one. Is a family really a mother, a father, and a kid or two? I hope not, because if that\u2019s a family, then I haven\u2019t got one. And neither do a lot of other people I know. For instance, Nannie, Mom\u2019s mother, lives all by herself. But I still think of her as a family \u2014 a one-person family. And I think of my own family as a real family \u2026 I guess.\n\nWhat I mean is, well, my family didn\u2019t start out the way it is now. It started out as two families that split up and came together as \u2026 Uh\u2011oh. I know that\u2019s confusing. I\u2019m a little ahead of myself. I better back up and begin at the beginning.\n\nThis is the beginning: Hi! I\u2019m Kristy Thomas. I\u2019m thirteen years old. I\u2019m in eighth grade. I\u2019m the president of the Baby\u2011sitters Club (more about that later). I like sports, and I guess you could say I\u2019m a tomboy. (Well, wouldn\u2019t you be one if you had a whole bunch of brothers?) I\u2019m not the neatest person in the world. I don\u2019t care much about boys or clothes. I\u2019m famous for coming up with big ideas.\n\nOkay, enough about me. Let me tell you about \u2014",

          "text": "Knock, knock.\n\nDarn, I thought. Who could that be? It was a Friday evening and I didn\u2019t have any plans or even a baby\u2011sitting job. I was in my bedroom, just messing around, enjoying my free time.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d I called.\n\n\u201cOswald!\u201d my little sister replied.\n\nOswald? Oh\u2026. \u201cOswald who?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cHelp! Help! Oswald my gum!\u201d\n\nI was laughing as I opened the door and found a very giggly Karen in the hallway.\n\n\u201cPretty funny,\u201d I said, as Karen ran into my room and threw herself on my bed. \u201cWhere\u2019d you hear that one?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn school. Nancy told it to me. What are you doing with the door closed?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust fooling around.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is our first night here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Karen. I didn\u2019t mean to shut you out. It\u2019s just that I had a rotten week at school and today was especially rotten, so I wanted to be by myself for awhile.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering why Karen said, \u201cBut this is our first night here.\u201d I think now would be a good time to explain my family to you. See, Karen isn\u2019t exactly my sister. She\u2019s my stepsister. Her little brother Andrew is my stepbrother, and her father is my stepfather. Karen and Andrew only live with us part\u2011time. I like when they come over because then my family consists of Mom, Watson (he\u2019s my stepfather), Sam, Charlie, and David Michael (they\u2019re my brothers), and Karen and Andrew. Oh, and Shannon and Boo\u2011Boo. They\u2019re our dog and cat, and they\u2019re part of the family, too.\n\nHow did I get this weird family? Well, you can probably imagine. My mom and dad were divorced. They got divorced right after David Michael was born. Then, a couple of years ago, Mom met Watson and started going out with him. Watson was divorced, too. And after awhile, Mom and Watson got married, and then Mom and my brothers and I moved into Watson\u2019s house. That\u2019s how I got my big family. The only unusual thing is that Watson is a millionaire. Honest. That\u2019s why we moved into his house. It\u2019s a lot bigger than our old one. It\u2019s huge. In fact, it\u2019s basically a mansion. Living in a mansion here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, is fun, but sometimes I miss my old house. It\u2019s on the other side of town, where all my friends are.\n\nSo now I\u2019m part of a six\u2011kid family. My brother Charlie is the oldest kid. He\u2019s seventeen, a senior in high school, and thinks he\u2019s a big shot. Sam is fifteen. He\u2019s a sophomore in high school. Then there\u2019s me, then David Michael, who\u2019s seven, and then Karen and Andrew, who are six and four. Usually, Karen and Andrew only live with us every other weekend and for two weeks during the summer. The rest of the time they live with their mother, who\u2019s not too far away \u2014 in a different neighborhood in Stoneybrook. But the night Karen bounced into my room with her knock\u2011knock joke was the beginning of a much longer stay. Karen and Andrew were going to be with us for several weeks while their mother and stepfather went on a business trip.\n\n\u201cKnock, knock,\u201d said Karen again.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cHey, Karen! Come here!\u201d It was David Michael, yelling down the hall.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Karen yelled back.\n\n\u201cCome look at this bug!\u201d (David Michael just loves bugs.)\n\nKaren was off my bed and out of my room in a flash.\n\nI smiled. I really like my family, especially when Karen and Andrew are here. The bigger, the better. Sometimes I think of my friends as family, too. Is that weird? I don\u2019t know. But my friends do feel like family. I guess I\u2019m mostly talking about my friends in the Baby\u2011sitters Club. That\u2019s a club I started myself. Actually, it\u2019s more of a business. My friends and I sit for families in Stoneybrook and we earn a lot of money.",

That\u2019s the way it is with families.\n\nFor instance, I\u2019m pretty outgoing (some people say I have a big mouth), and as I mentioned before, I like sports and couldn\u2019t care less about clothes or boys. My best friend is Mary Anne Spier (she\u2019s our club secretary) and we are different. Mary Anne is quiet and shy, hates sports, is becoming interested in clothes, has a boyfriend, and comes from a very small family. She lives with just her dad and her kitten, Tigger. Her mom died a long time ago. Mary Anne and I have always been different and have always been best friends. We lived next door to each other until Mom married Watson, so we practically grew up together. One thing that\u2019s the same about us is our looks. We both have brown hair and brown eyes and are short for our age.\n\nThe vice\u2011president of the Baby\u2011sitters Club is Claudia Kishi. Claud lives across the street from Mary Anne. There is nothing, and I mean nothing, typical or average or ordinary about Claudia. To begin with, she\u2019s Japanese\u2011American. Her hair is silky and long and jet\u2011black.

          "text": "\"I just don\u2019t understand,\" Dawn Schafer said to me as we slowed down for a stop sign. \u201cHow can someone as small as Tigger knock his toys behind the refrigerator, so that you can\u2019t even get to them?\u201d\n\nI shrugged. Then I checked the street. The coast was clear, so we pedaled across the intersection. \u201cHe just does, that\u2019s all,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd thank you for calling Tigger a someone instead of a something.\u201d\n\nDawn smiled. \u201cI still don\u2019t get it, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I know,\u201d I said, \u201cis that his toys roll into that space between the wall and the side of the fridge, where I ought to be able to get them out. You know where I mean?\u201d (Dawn nodded.) \u201cWell, they roll in there and I never see them again.\u201d\n\n\u201cSort of a black hole for cat toys,\u201d said Dawn.\n\nI giggled. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing underneath the fridge. I looked there with a flashlight. That leaves in back of the fridge. And I can\u2019t get there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is why we\u2019re riding our bikes all the way downtown just to buy cat toys,\u201d said Dawn.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d I replied.\n\nIn case you can\u2019t tell, Dawn Schafer is my friend. (I\u2019m Mary Anne Spier.) Dawn is one of my best friends, in fact. And Tigger is my kitten. My one and only. He\u2019s a gray tiger cat with very pretty stripes. If I do say so, he\u2019s smart. Smart and pretty. And he can catch flies, which is difficult. I mean, when you only have paws.\n\nDawn and I were on our way to downtown Stoneybrook, Connecticut, to stock up on cat toys for Tigger, since he keeps losing them behind the fridge. His favorites are those plastic balls with a little bell inside. They come three in a pack, and he loses about three a week, so cat toys can be expensive to me. Thank goodness I earn lots of money baby-sitting.\n\nDawn and I stopped at a traffic light. We had reached Stoneybrook\u2019s main street (which is about as small as Stoneybrook is), and were only three blocks from the pet store.\n\n\u201cHey, what did your dad say about the date last night?\u201d asked Dawn.\n\nWe laughed. Dawn\u2019s mom and my dad go out sometimes. We really wish they would get married, but we can\u2019t help laughing. It\u2019s just so weird to see your own parents dating. Especially dating each other. They go out with other people, too, but when Dawn\u2019s mom has a date with my dad, she puts on all this makeup and checks her clothes twenty times and then asks Dawn to check her clothes again. And my dad puts on after-shave that smells like the dentist\u2019s office and gets nervous and can barely speak to me. Then they go somewhere together. What a pair.\n\nBy the way, the reason they can date is Dawn\u2019s parents are divorced and my mom died ages ago. I really don\u2019t even remember her.\n\n\u201cI think my dad had fun when they went out,\u201d I told Dawn. \u201cWhat about your mom?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame,\u201d she replied. Then she announced, \u201cPet store,\u201d and stopped her bike. \u201cHey, I just thought of something.\u201d Dawn was grinning.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she replied, \u201cthere\u2019s not much space behind your refrigerator, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d We were chaining our bikes to a lamppost.\n\n\u201cProbably just enough space for the width of one toy, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Tigger\u2019s toys are probably behind the fridge in a line. And when the line reaches the wall, there won\u2019t be room for any more toys, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d I replied as we entered the store.",

          "text": "I headed for the cat toy department and picked up two packages of Tigger\u2019s toys. In one package, the balls were half pink and half green. In the other, they were half orange and half yellow. I like to give Tigger a little variety in his toys. Then I began looking over the cat treats. Maybe I should buy some fancy food for Tigger.\n\nI was counting my money when Dawn tapped me on the arm. \u201cWe better go,\u201d she said. \u201cClub meeting in forty\u2011five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. Just let me buy these.\u201d I held up the toys.\n\nI stood in line at the counter, thinking about the Baby\u2011sitters Club. My closest friends are all in the club: Kristy Thomas (she\u2019s my other best friend), Claudia Kishi, Jessi Ramsey, Mallory Pike, Dawn, and Logan Bruno (an associate member, who doesn\u2019t usually attend club meetings. I\u2019ll explain that later). Logan is basically my boyfriend, and he is incredible in every way. He\u2019s incredible-looking and incredibly nice and incredibly thoughtful and, well, incredibly incredible.\n\n(There is also one person who\u2019s in the club who is not a close friend, and one person who is a close friend who\u2019s not really in the club anymore. I\u2019ll tell you about them later.)\n\nThe Baby\u2011sitters Club is more a business than a club. My friends and I sit for families in our neighborhoods. We get a lot of jobs and earn a lot of money. And I spend a lot of my money right here in the pet store. The club was started by Kristy Thomas, our president. (I\u2019m the secretary, by the way.) In some ways, Kristy is like me, but in more ways, she\u2019s my exact opposite. I think that\u2019s why she was my very first best friend. That and the fact that we lived next door to each other from the time we were born. Here are the things that are the same about us: We\u2019re small for our age and have brown hair and brown eyes. Here are the ways in which we\u2019re different: I\u2019m shy and sort of held in; Kristy is outgoing and can be a loudmouth. I\u2019m beginning to take an interest in what I wear; Kristy couldn\u2019t care less. She always wears jeans, a turtleneck, a sweater, and running shoes. (Well, not in the summer, of course, but you know what I mean.)\n\nKristy has more ideas than anyone I know. She\u2019s always thinking of things to do, or finding ways to solve problems. You can almost see her brain at work. Lately, Kristy\u2019s life hasn\u2019t been too easy, though. It hasn\u2019t been bad, just not easy. For the longest time, she lived with her mom, her three brothers, and her collie, Louie, right next door to me. (Her parents had gotten a divorce.) Then her mom met this millionaire, Watson Brewer, and the next thing I knew, they\u2019d decided to get married. After the wedding, K",

Special tea is when my grandmother prepares Japanese tea and serves it in cups with no handles that she brought with her when she moved from Japan to America.

Mimi\u2019s were wrinkled and brown like walnuts, and they shook. Mimi is my mother\u2019s mother and she\u2019s getting pretty old.\n\nAs you have probably guessed, Mimi is Japanese. She came to the United States a long time ago, when she was thirty\u2011two. Her husband was Japanese, too, so of course my mom is Japanese. And so is my dad. Janine and I consider ourselves not just Japanese, but Japanese\u2011American, meaning that we\u2019re full\u2011blooded Asian but we\u2019ve lived all our lives in the U.S. Actually, we\u2019ve lived all our lives here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. And Mimi has lived all of my life in Stoneybrook, because her husband died after Mom and Dad got married, so she moved in with them. Both of my parents were working. They were doing different things then, but now Dad is a partner in an investment firm in Stamford, Connecticut, which is nearby, and Mom is the head librarian at our public library. Anyway, when my grandfather died, Janine the genius had just been born, so Mimi\u2019s moving in seemed like the perfect arrangement. Three years later, I was born, and there was Mimi to help raise me. Mimi is my friend and the person who understands me the best in the world, even better than my friends.",

She\u2019s smart enough to be a high school junior who takes courses at a college in Stoneybrook. That\u2019s right, a college. When I say she\u2019s a genius, I mean it. Her I.Q. is, like, nine million or something. We used to sort of hate each other, but as we grow up, we get along much better. For one thing, we\u2019ve been worried about Mimi a lot lately, and that\u2019s brought us closer together. Worry and fear can do that.\n\nI looked around my messy room.

A flying saucer had crashed through our roof, and Martians were streaming down the staircase to capture us and take us off to Spacecreatureland.\n\nSo what was it? Fortunately, the answer was: None of the Above. The truth was, Becca was only calling us because of a TV show. The show had just come on and she wanted us to watch it with her.\n\nMama, Daddy, Squirt, and I were in the kitchen, cleaning up after dinner. Well, Squirt wasn\u2019t exactly cleaning up.

          "text": "Maybe I should introduce myself and my family before I start the story. My full name is Jessica Davis Ramsey, but everybody calls me Jessi. I\u2019m eleven years old and in sixth grade. I\u2019m black, and just to give you an idea of how few black families live here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, I\u2019ll tell you that I\u2019m the only black kid in my entire grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. I keep my hair long because I take ballet class two times a week and ballerinas are supposed to be able to pull their hair back. Probably my best feature is my legs. They\u2019re long, long, long, which is great for dancing. My grandma always says they\u2019re graceful, too. And Mama says I move like a cat. I take that as a compliment.\n\nYou can tell I have a nice family. I live with my parents, eight\u2011year\u2011old sister Becca (that\u2019s short for Rebecca) and my baby brother Squirt. No, his real name\u2019s not Squirt, it\u2019s John Philip Ramsey, Jr. But when he was born, he was the tiniest baby in the hospital, so the nurses gave him a special nickname.\n\nAs I said, my family and I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, but we used to live in Oakley, New Jersey, and that was great because my grandparents lived on the same street as we did and so did a lot of my aunts and uncles and cousins. One of my cousins, Keisha, was my very best friend. She and I have the exact same birthday, and Keisha always seemed to know what I was feeling about things.\n\nI\u2019d lived in Oakley since I was a baby, but then Daddy\u2019s company transferred him to Stamford, Connecticut, so we found this house in Stoneybrook, nearby. I\u2019ll tell you honestly, sometimes I still miss Oakley. It was a little easier to be myself there. And I especially miss Keisha. I mean, how many best friends have known each other since they were one day old?\n\nWell, Stoneybrook doesn\u2019t have Keisha. And it doesn\u2019t have my wonderful grandparents or my aunts and uncles. But it does offer a lot of other things. Since we moved here, I enrolled in a very good ballet school in Stamford. To get in, I had to audition. And then Daddy built me my very own ballet barre and practice area in our basement. I also found myself another best friend. Her name is Mallory Pike. And because of Mallory, I now belong to one of the greatest clubs in the world \u2014 the Baby\u2011sitters Club. Maybe that\u2019s been the best thing about moving to Stoneybrook.\n\nThe club was the great idea of Kristy Thomas. She\u2019s an eighth\u2011grader who goes to my school. Last year, when she was in seventh grade, she got together with a bunch of friends who love to baby\u2011sit and they formed a club. They sent out fliers to all the families in the neighborhood \u2014 very professional \u2014 and pretty soon they had a booming business. Leave it to Kristy. She\u2019s a take\u2011charge type of person. The club meets three afternoons a week \u2014 Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 5:30 until 6:00 \u2014 and families who need a baby\u2011sitter know to call us up during club hours. The great thing is that one of us is bound to be free. So our clients are sure of getting a sitter and, meanwhile, we get plenty of jobs. Everybody\u2019s happy!\n\nAll the club members are eighth\u2011graders except for Mallory and me. Mallory got in because all the Baby\u2011sitters knew her. See, the girls had sat a lot for Mallory\u2019s family, the Pikes. Oh, I guess I forgot to tell you. Mallory is from a big family, and I\u2019m talking big. Believe it or not, there are eight kids in the Pike family. Mallory\u2019s the oldest. Mrs. Pike used to hire sitters from the club and Mallory would always help them out. Of course, being the oldest of eight, Mallory was always great with the kids. So when there was an opening in the club, Kristy decided to let her in. Lucky me, she decided to let me in at the same time!",

Henry and Grace and I live really near the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, and Henry likes to visit the dinosaur exhibits.\n\nHenry shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t really matter. I\u2019ll just pretend a steg could beat a bronto.\u201d (Henry is on familiar terms with dinosaurs. Oh, excuse me. With dinos.)",

          "text": "Maybe I better stop here and introduce Henry and Grace and myself. I am Stacey McGill and I\u2019m thirteen years old. Henry and Grace and I live on the Upper West Side of New York City. In fact, we live in the same building. I live on the 12th floor and the Walkers live on the 18th floor. Mr. and Mrs. Walker are artists, and Henry and Grace, who are five and three, are my two favorite baby\u2011sitting charges.\n\nBelieve me, I do a lot of baby\u2011sitting. Sometimes I\u2019m amazed by all the things that have happened to me because of baby\u2011sitting. For instance, I live in a large (okay, a huge) apartment building with plenty of little kids, but not many kids my age \u2014 and hardly anyone else who\u2019s interested in sitting. So I get a lot of jobs, have a lot of fun (especially with Henry and Grace), and earn a lot of money.\n\nThat\u2019s just the beginning, though. I\u2019ve lived in New York City all my life except for one year. That year, my parents and I (I\u2019m an only child) lived in a small town in Connecticut called Stoneybrook. My dad had been transferred there by the company he works for. We thought the move was going to be permanent, so I was desperate to make friends in Stoneybrook \u2014 and fast. Guess how baby\u2011sitting helped me. I heard about this group of girls who were starting something called the Baby\u2011sitters Club. They wanted to run a business sitting for families in the neighborhood \u2014 and they were looking for another member! So I joined. Instant friends. I\u2019m still really close to most of the girls in the club, especially Claudia Kishi. She\u2019s my Connecticut best friend. (My New York best friend is Laine Cummings.) Then there\u2019re Dawn Schafer, Mary Anne Spier, and Kristy Thomas. They\u2019re good friends, too. Mallory Pike is a little young to be a close friend, and I don\u2019t know Jessi Ramsey too well yet (Mal and Jessi replaced me when Dad was transferred again, and we moved back to New York), but I still consider them friends.\n\nAnyway, yes, that\u2019s right. After a year in Connecticut, Dad\u2019s stupid company transferred him right back to where he\u2019d been. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I New York, just like the bumper stickers and the T\u2011shirts say. I really do it. I the stores, especially Bloomingdale\u2019s, the theaters, the museums, the parks, the excitement. I even tourists, because they add to the excitement. But I didn\u2019t all the trauma and trouble of moving twice in just a little over a year.\n\nStill, we did move, and when we got back to New York I was thirteen, not twelve, and we moved into this huge building with all these kids, and I\u2019ve been sitting practically ever since. Things aren\u2019t the same without the Baby\u2011sitters Club, even though I consider myself the New York branch of the BSC. But I wouldn\u2019t trade big\u2011city life for anything.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t trade sitting for the Walkers, either. I adore Henry and Grace. There\u2019s just something wonderful about them. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re well behaved (which they are). It\u2019s not that they\u2019re creative and can always be entertained with art projects. No, I think it\u2019s that they\u2019re such caring kids. They look out for each other, they stick up for their friends, and they try very hard never to hurt anybody\u2019s feelings.",

          "text": "So of course Henry was pleasant about my being in outer space the afternoon he asked his dinosaur question, and then about my not knowing the answer.\n\n\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d I asked Grace, looking at her picture.\n\nGrace was bent over, concentrating hard. She was drawing slowly and carefully, her tongue sticking out of the corner of her mouth.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d she replied, straightening up. \u201cDo you like my picture, Stacey? It\u2019s an elephant. And the elephant is in a bathtub, but there\u2019s no water in it. He\u2019s taking a nap. See? There\u2019s his pillow.\u201d\n\nHenry giggled. \u201cGive him a blanket,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd show that he\u2019s dreaming about a bronto.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I draw a dream?\u201d wondered Grace. She pulled at her curly hair.\n\n\u201cLike this.\u201d Henry drew a \u201cdream bubble\u201d over the elephant\u2019s head. \u201cNow put a bronto in there,\u201d he instructed his little sister.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Grace. \u201cThank you, Henry.\u201d\n\nI smiled. What terrific kids. In fact, the whole Walker family is terrific. Mr. Walker is an artist and Mrs. Walker illustrates children\u2019s books. They\u2019re both pretty well known. The reason I was sitting for Grace and Henry that Wednesday afternoon was that a showing of Mr. Walker\u2019s work was going to open soon, and the Walkers had gone to the gallery to help supervise the hanging of some of his paintings. I guess another thing you should know about the Walkers is that they\u2019re black. There aren\u2019t too many black families in our building. You know what\u2019s funny, though? When I\u2019m with the Walkers I don\u2019t think of them as black, just as people. I feel the same way when I\u2019m with Jessi Ramsey, one of the new members of the BSC. I don\u2019t see her as black, just as an eleven\u2011year\u2011old baby\u2011sitter who\u2019s Mallory Pike\u2019s best friend. I have never understood the big deal about black or",

          "text": "I closed my journal with a snap. I have been keeping a journal for some time now. The difference between a journal and a diary, as far as I can tell, is that a diary is a recording of daily events and you\u2019re supposed to write in it every day. For me, a diary entry would probably go like this (on a weekday):\n\nPretty dull, huh? But a journal entry would be much more deep and sensitive and interesting. Also, I don\u2019t write in my journal every day, just whenever I feel like it. And my journal is a plain old composition book. You know, one of the ones with a mottled black-and-white cover. It\u2019s not set up with four lines for March 2nd, four lines for March 3rd, four lines for March 4th, etc. It\u2019s blank. So I can write as much or as little whenever I want. And I only write when I feel an urgency, which is often \u2014 whenever I\u2019m angry or confused or think I haven\u2019t been treated fairly. Also when good things happen.\n\nYesterday I didn\u2019t write in my journal at all. Today, which is Sunday, I was feeling sort of pensive, so I wrote:\n\nI hid my journal under my mattress. As far as I know, Vanessa hasn\u2019t found it there. It wouldn\u2019t be like her to go looking for it, though. Vanessa is a poet, and understands the need to keep your writing private.\n\nWho\u2019s Vanessa? She\u2019s my sister. I have seven younger brothers and sisters in all. After me (I\u2019m Mallory Pike) come the triplets \u2014 Byron, Adam, and Jordan. They\u2019re ten. Then there\u2019s Vanessa, who\u2019s nine; Nicky, who\u2019s eight; Margo, who\u2019s seven; and Claire, the baby of the family. Claire is five and very silly. She calls everybody a silly-billy-goo-goo. For instance, my Claire-name is Mallory-silly-billy-goo-goo.\n\nJust as I was hiding my journal, I heard Mom call from downstairs, \u201cMal? Can you come here for a sec?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d I replied.",

I know they moved in a week ago, but I figure a casserole is always appreciated.

Well, while Mom\u2019s casserole cools, I\u2019ll tell you about the McGills and my BSC friends.\n\nFirst of all, the BSC is a club that I belong to. It\u2019s really more of a business, and the other people in it are my friends Jessi Ramsey, Stacey McGill, Kristy Thomas, Dawn Schafer, Mary Anne Spier, and Claudia Kishi. What our club does is baby\u2011sit for families here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. It is super\u2011fun, and I feel very cool to be allowed in it.\n\nYou see, the club was started by Kristy, Claudia, Stacey, and Mary Anne, who are all thirteen years old now and in eighth grade. Jessi and I are the only eleven\u2011year\u2011old sixth\u2011graders. I am so glad the club is back together again. For quite a while, we had to do without Stacey missing. In fact, Kristy (she\u2019s the club president) asked Jessi and me to join when Stacey\u2019s family moved from Stoneybrook back to New York City, which was where they\u2019d come from in the first place. (They\u2019d moved both times because Mr. McGill\u2019s company kept transferring him.) Then, after they moved back to New York, Mr. and Mrs. McGill decided to get divorced. They\u2019d been having problems for a while. So Mr. McGill stayed in New York with his job, and Mrs. McGill and Stacey returned to Stoneybrook. Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t move into their old house. Guess why? Jessi Ramsey\u2019s family had moved into it! But Stacey and her mom found a nice old house that they like \u2014 and it\u2019s right behind ours. If there weren\u2019t so many trees in the way, I\u2019d be able to look out our back windows and into Stacey\u2019s back windows. Maybe that will happen when the trees are bare. At any rate, it\u2019s nice to be able to walk out our back door, through our backyard, and right into Stacey\u2019s backyard.\n\nOn the day that Mom fixed the casserole, the McGills had been back for a week and a day. That meant that Stacey had been to three BSC meetings since her return \u2014 and, boy, were the rest of us glad to have her back.",

I\u2019m starting with her because she\u2019s the president of the club. She dreamed it up and got it going. Kristy is part of an interesting family. She has two older brothers, Sam and Charlie, who are in high school, and one much younger brother, David Michael. He\u2019s seven. Kristy\u2019s parents are divorced. They got divorced a long time ago and Kristy never sees her father. However, last summer her mother married this millionaire, Watson Brewer, who whisked the Thomases across town to his mansion. (Kristy used to live on Bradford Court, next to her best friend, Mary Anne Spier, and across the street from Claudia Kishi. But not anymore.) Watson has two little kids, Karen and Andrew, who are six and four. They\u2019re from his first marriage and live at the Brewer mansion every other weekend. (The rest of the time they live with their mother.) Kristy adores them. It\u2019s a full household \u2014 and even fuller since Nannie, Kristy\u2019s grandmother, moved in to help run the house after the Brewers adopted Emily Michelle, a two\u2011year\u2011old Vietnamese girl.\n\nKristy is brown\u2011haired, brown\u2011eyed, the shortest kid in her class, and doesn\u2019t care a bit about clothes.

What Dawn meant about her mother was that Mrs. Schafer is absentminded and scatterbrained. It\u2019s okay for me to say that because Dawn says it all the time.\n\nShe said it again now. \u201cMom is so scatterbrained!\u201d (Dawn had just found a high heel in the vegetable drawer of the refrigerator.) She removed it, set it gently on the floor, and said to the shoe, \u201cI hope you thaw out okay.\u201d Then she turned to me. \u201cWell? What do you want for dinner? I mean, besides shoes. Mom left a tofu casserole in the fridge \u2014 I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t leave it in her closet \u2014 but I have a feeling you won\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have any peanut butter?\u201d I asked hopefully.\n\n\u201cYes, but it\u2019s all natural, with no sugar or salt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d That was better than tofu.\n\nI made myself a peanut\u2011butter\u2011and\u2011honey sandwich while Dawn made herself a salad.\n\nWe were getting used to these evenings.

          "text": "I guess I should stop and explain who Dawn and I are before I tell you any more about our evening. Okay. Besides being best friends, we live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, and we\u2019re both thirteen years old and in eighth grade. My name is Mary Anne Spier. I\u2019ve lived in Stoneybrook all my life, in the same house, but Dawn moved here in the middle of seventh grade. She moved because her parents got divorced \u2014 and she moved all the way from California! She came with her mom and her younger brother, Jeff. The reason they chose to live in Stoneybrook was that Mrs. Schafer grew up here.\n\nOne really sad thing (I mean, apart from the divorce and the move), was that Jeff was never happy here. He couldn\u2019t adjust to Connecticut, and he missed California and his dad too much. So after awhile, he moved back there to live with Mr. Schafer. Dawn misses the California half of her family a lot, but she talks to them on the phone pretty often and seems happy in Connecticut now.\n\nAnyway, so Dawn was living here with her mom and no dad, and I\u2019d been living here with my dad and no mom (my mother died when I was really little), and one day the most amazing thing happened. When Dawn was unpacking the stuff her family had moved to Connecticut (and, as you can imagine, this took forever, since Mrs. Schafer wasn\u2019t much help), she came across her mother\u2019s high school yearbook. It was from her senior year, so of course she looked up her mom\u2019s picture. Then she looked up my dad\u2019s picture, since we knew they\u2019d gone to school together. And guess what we found out. Our parents had been in love years and years ago!\n\nBut their parents \u2014 well, Dawn\u2019s grandparents \u2014 didn\u2019t approve of the relationship. See, the Porters (Dawn\u2019s mom\u2019s name used to be Sharon Porter) were quite wealthy. And the Spiers were not, although \u2014 fake out \u2014 Dad put himself through law school and became pretty successful.\n\nAnyway, the Porters encouraged Dawn\u2019s mother to go to college in California (as far away as she could get from Dad), and my father and Dawn\u2019s mom finally went their separate ways. They each got married, and I think they even forgot about each other \u2014 sort of.\n\nThen Dawn and I reintroduced them and they began seeing each other again. At first they took things really slowly. Dad is this reserved, somewhat shy man who hadn\u2019t dated in years (not since he and my mother had dated), and he didn\u2019t want to rush into anything. Dawn\u2019s mom didn\u2019t want to rush into anything, either. But she loved dating again. She\u2019s very outgoing. For the longest time she went out with this awful, preppy guy whose nickname was Trip, and whom Dawn and Jeff hated and called the Trip\u2011Man. She went out with some other men, too. (That was because after she got a job, people at work kept fixing her up with their single friends.)\n\nAll along, though, she and Dad would see each other from time to time, but now they\u2019re the only people they date. And they go out a lot. That\u2019s why Dawn and I were so used to these evenings together. In fact, we weren\u2019t just used to them, we liked them!",

We don\u2019t get cable.\n\n\u201cA Hayley Mills festival.\u201d\n\nDawn just loves this kid who was an actress back in the sixties. Actually, I kind of like her, too. My favorite Hayley Mills movie is Pollyanna. Dawn\u2019s is The Parent Trap.\n\n\u201cA Hayley Mills festival?\u201d I repeated.\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d said Dawn jubilantly. \u201cThey\u2019re going to show Pollyanna, That Darn Cat, The Parent Trap, and The Moon\u2011Spinners.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll take hours!\u201d I cried.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d replied Dawn. \u201cI figure a good ten, if you count commercials and cable\u2011TV ads.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen does the festival start?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cRight now! So let\u2019s get our trays.\u201d\n\nThis is one thing I love about Dawn\u2019s house. You can eat in places other than the kitchen and the dining room. At my house there are a lot of rules. Dad used to have even more. He used to be really strict, but as I\u2019ve grown up, he\u2019s loosened up. However, I would never be allowed to eat dinner on a tray in front of the TV.\n\nSo I carried my sandwich and a banana into the den, and Dawn carried this bean\u2011sprout\u2011and\u2011chickpea salad into the den, and we sat down to eat and to get our fill of Hayley Mills. After about an hour, though, we\u2019d had our fill. The first movie shown was Pollyanna, and although we both like it, we\u2019d seen it recently.\n\n\u201cI guess there really is something to that saying about too much of a good thing,\u201d said Dawn.\n\nI nodded. \u201cYeah. Let\u2019s do something else.\u201d\n\nFirst we cleaned up our mess from dinner. (We didn\u2019t really need to, since Mrs. Schafer never notices messes, but we always feel we ought to.)

          "text": "Mom\u2019s wedding bouquet was flying through the air. Mary Anne, my new stepsister, and I were both leaping for it. At the last second, Mary Anne\u2019s arms seemed to grow about five inches, and even though she is not terribly coordinated, she caught the bouquet.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nThe bouquet was my mother\u2019s. I should have caught it. Well, that wasn\u2019t quite true. I don\u2019t know of any rule that says a daughter should catch her mom\u2019s bouquet. Plus, there were several people behind Mary Anne and me \u2014 several other women who wanted to catch it, too \u2014 and we were all supposed to have an equal shot at it. Why did we want to catch it so badly? Because there\u2019s this belief that if an unmarried woman catches the bride\u2019s bouquet after the bride has tossed it, that woman will be the next to get married.\n\nNow Mary Anne and I are only thirteen, so we didn\u2019t have any plans to get married, but I still thought I should have caught my own mother\u2019s bouquet. Anyway, I guess Mary Anne just tried a little harder than I did. After all, she\u2019s got a boyfriend. Logan Bruno. Maybe she hopes they\u2019ll get married someday, when they\u2019re older and ready for it.\n\nAnyway, Mary Anne was holding the bouquet triumphantly over her head. \"I caught it!\" she said with a gasp.\n\nWell, of course she\u2019d caught it. She\u2019d practically killed the rest of us in the process. I don\u2019t know why she was so surprised.\n\nEveryone was laughing and cheering.\n\n\"All right, Mary Anne!\" called Kristy Thomas, one of her best friends.\n\nI got into the spirit of things. Mary Anne is shy \u2014 extremely shy. And she\u2019s one of the nicest people I know. She\u2019s my best friend, she\u2019s now my stepsister, and she does have a boyfriend, while I don\u2019t. So I didn\u2019t mind too much that she\u2019d caught the bouquet. I found myself turning to her and giving her a big hug.\n\n\"Congratulations \u2026 sis!\" I said.\n\nMary Anne, the world\u2019s teariest person alive, immediately began to cry.\n\n\"Sis,\" she repeated. \"It\u2019s really true. We\u2019re stepsisters now.\"\n\n\"No, just sisters,\" I corrected her.\n\nMary Anne\u2019s tears flowed harder. \"Thanks \u2026 sis,\" she replied.",

          "text": "It was my mother\u2019s wedding day. Well, it was her second wedding day. Her first one had been sixteen years ago, when she married my father. About fourteen years later they had gotten divorced. We were living in California then \u2014 Mom; Dad; my younger brother, Jeff; and I. After the divorce, Mom moved Jeff and me here to Stoneybrook, Connecticut. She didn\u2019t choose Stoneybrook randomly. Stoneybrook is the town where she grew up, and her parents, my grandparents, were still living here. It was also the town where she had gone to school with a guy she liked a lot (although that didn\u2019t have anything to do with her decision to move back here). The guy\u2019s name was Richard Spier, and he is Mary Anne\u2019s father. She and Mr. Sp \u2014 I mean, Richard (Mary Anne and I had decided to call our stepparents by their first names, Richard and Sharon) had dated when they were in high school. But my grandparents hadn\u2019t approved of Richard. Mom\u2019s family had a lot of money; Richard\u2019s didn\u2019t. They said he came from the wrong side of the tracks. What soreheads. And they saw to it that after graduation, their daughter (my mother) got as far away from Richard as she could. They sent her to college in California. That\u2019s where she met and married my dad. Meanwhile, back here in Connecticut, Richard met and married Mary Anne\u2019s mom. He put himself through law school and got a good job (fake out on my grandparents), even though some terrible things happened. His parents died, Mary Anne\u2019s mother\u2019s parents died \u2014 and Mary Anne\u2019s mom died. It was awful. Mary Anne was quite young when she lost her mother and barely remembers her. Still, I think it must have been terrible to be almost alone in the world, just Richard and Mary Anne.\n\nBut fate intervened. (I read that sentence in a book once. Isn\u2019t it great?) Mom and Jeff and I moved back here, and in no time, Mary Anne and I not only met and became friends, but figured out that our parents had been in love years ago. We reintroduced them and \u2014 zap! They started dating and today they\u2019d gotten married. Finally. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if they\u2019d gotten married after high school. For one thing, Mary Anne and Jeff and I wouldn\u2019t be here, at least not in these particular bodies. That was a weird thought.\n\nI guess you probably want to know a little about the wedding. Well, since it was the second one for both Mom and Richard, they\u2019d kept it simple and small. Mom didn\u2019t even wear a wedding gown, just a gorgeous new dress. They got married in the chapel of a local church and didn\u2019t have any attendants. (Mary Anne and I were awfully disappointed. We\u2019d wanted to be bridesmaids.) The guests were three friends of my brother\u2019s (the Pike triplets), Mary Anne\u2019s and my friends from the Baby-sitters Club (I\u2019ll tell you more about the BSC later), some work friends of Mom\u2019s and Richard\u2019s, and my grandparents. Mary Anne\u2019s and my friends (just so you know) were: Kristy Thomas, Stacey McGill, Jessi Ramsey, Mallory Pike (she\u2019s the triplets\u2019 sister), Claudia Kishi, and Logan Bruno. Even though the wedding ceremony was short, it was pretty traditional. There were flowers at the altar, Mom and Richard said vows and exchanged rings, Richard kissed my mother on the lips in front of absolutely everybody, and Mom even wore something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.",

Emily was jumping up and down and crying. Well, she wasn\u2019t exactly jumping, since she can\u2019t get her feet off the ground yet. She was just doing fast knee\u2011bends. And her face was as red as a tomato.\n\n\"Wah\u2011ah\u2011ah\u2011ah\u2011ah\u2011ah,\" she wails in frustration.\n\nDavid Michael looked flustered. \"I did exactly what you told me to do,\" he said. \"I put the remote control up there,\" (he pointed to a shelf) \"and Emily began crying.\"\n\n\"Well, don\u2019t worry,\" I said. \"You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Look, here\u2019s your snack.\" I handed him half a sandwich. \"You eat that and I\u2019ll calm Emily down.\"",

          "text": "What a wild family I have. I love baby\u2011sitting for my little brothers and sisters (there are four of them all together \u2014 I\u2019ll explain that in a minute), but sometimes things can get touchy.\n\nDavid Michael sat at one end of the couch in the den, eating his sandwich, watching Gorilla Man, and occasionally casting wounded glances in my direction.\n\nMeanwhile, I tried to calm Emily down. I sat her on my lap in the armchair and explained that the remote control is for bigger people who know what all the buttons do. Then I said that it was polite to ask somebody if you could change channels before you actually did it. I purposely said that, instead of saying that what Emily had done was rude or wrong or bad. With children \u2014 or with anyone for that matter \u2014 it\u2019s much more helpful to tell them what to do instead of what not to do. Also, children are sensitive and I didn\u2019t want to hurt Emily\u2019s feelings.\n\nAll my talk was probably wasted, though. See, Emily is our adopted sister. She\u2019s two years old and she came to us from Vietnam. So first of all, she doesn\u2019t talk much, and second, she\u2019s just beginning to understand English.\n\nI told you I have a wild family. Here are the people in it: Mom; my stepfather, Watson Brewer; my seventeen\u2011year\u2011old brother, Charlie; my fifteen\u2011year\u2011old brother, Sam; David Michael (he\u2019s seven); Emily; Karen and Andrew, who are Watson\u2019s kids from his first marriage (Karen is seven and Andrew is almost five); and Nannie. Nannie is Mom\u2019s mother, my grandmother. She moved in with us after we adopted Emily. Nannie\u2019s husband had died years earlier, Nannie was tired of living alone, and we needed someone to help care for Emily, since both Mom and Watson work.\n\nAs you can imagine, we need a pretty big house for all these people. Luckily, Watson just happens to be a millionaire. Honest. He really is. So after he and Mom got married, my family moved across town to live in his mansion. The house is so big that everyone has his or her own room, even Karen and Andrew, who only live with us every other weekend.\n\nWhat happened to my real father? He walked out on Mom and my brothers and me not long after David Michael was born, and we hardly ever hear from him. He usually forgets our birthdays. Sometimes he even forgets to send us Christmas presents or cards. All I know about him now is that he\u2019s living in California somewhere. Or at least he was the last time he bothered to call. We live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, so my father is about as far away from us as he can get without leaving the continental United States.\n\nOh! I almost forgot! My name is Kristy Thomas and I\u2019m thirteen and in eighth grade. And there are two other members of the Brewer/Thomas household \u2014 Shannon, who is David Michael\u2019s puppy (she\u2019s a Bernese mountain dog), and Boo\u2011Boo, Watson\u2019s cat. Nobody except Watson likes Boo\u2011Boo very much. Boo\u2011Boo is old and fat and cranky. If you\u2019re not careful, he\u2019ll scratch or bite you. But for some reason, he likes Shannon.\n\nOn that particular afternoon, I was baby\u2011sitting because everyone else was busy. Mom and Watson were at their jobs, Charlie and Sam were at after\u2011school activities at Stoneybrook High School, and Nannie was at bowling practice. That is one of the things I just love about Nannie. She doesn\u2019t seem like a grandmother at all. Her hair is barely gray, she\u2019s got tons of energy and is always off bowling or visiting friends or something, and she drives this rattly old car, which she painted pink and named the Pink Clinker. Recently, she attached a fake tail to the back of her car so that it looks like a cat is stuck in the trunk. (Charlie and Sam are embarrassed to be seen riding in the Pink Clinker.)\n\nWhen David Michael and Emily had calmed down and been playing happily for awhile, I checked my watch. It was almost five o\u2019clock. Soon Nannie would come home, and then Charlie and Sam would arrive from school. Charlie bought a used car not long ago so he can drive himself and Sam to school every day. The two of them think they are pretty cool.\n\nA little while later I heard Emily\u2019s bare feet running through the house, and her cries of, \"Nannie! Nannie!\" (\"Nannie\" is an easy word to say.)",

Good\u2011bye, everyone!\" I shouted. It was time for the changing of the guards. Nannie would begin fixing dinner, and Sam would watch Emily and David Michael.\n\nI dashed out to Charlie\u2019s car.

          "text": "Click, click, click.\n\nI watched the second hand on the clock in the front of my classroom work its way slowly around and around the dial. When the room was silent, as it was then, every time the hand on the clock jumped forward one second, it made a clicking sound.\n\nIt was a faithful old clock. You could depend on it. Every afternoon it clicked its way from 1:10 to 1:51, and when that second hand clicked over to the twelve at precisely 1:51, the bell rang \u2014 and I was released from the horrors of science class.\n\nI absolutely can\u2019t stand science, especially biology, which was what we were studying. I couldn\u2019t keep all those terms straight \u2014 cell and nucleus, species and phylum and genus, RNA and DNA and who knows what else. You know what is really stupid? The word species. If you have two different kinds of animals or something, then you have two species. But if you have only one kind, then you still have a species. Why not a specie? Or a specy? You don\u2019t have two cats and one cats.\n\nOh, well.\n\nClick, click, click.\n\nWe were supposed to be reading the instructions for an experiment we were going to perform in class that day. Now there\u2019s another stupid thing. Year after year, this same teacher makes his students perform the same experiments. Well, if the experiments have been done so many times before, how can they still be experiments? The teacher knows what is going to happen. I thought experimenting meant trying new things to see what would happen. We weren\u2019t experimenting at all. We were playacting.\n\nBut none of this really mattered. I, Claudia Kishi, was just biding my time. I was not going to have to perform the experiment that day. I was simply waiting for the clock to click to 1:20. Then I got to \u2026 leave early! I couldn\u2019t wait.\n\nWell, I couldn\u2019t wait to leave science class. I could wait for what I had to do after I left. What did I have to do? I had to go to an awards ceremony at which my older sister, Janine the Genius, was going to be given some big honor. As if she isn\u2019t always being awarded for something. Every time I turn around she\u2019s getting another certificate or prize, or she\u2019s made the honor roll or gotten straight A\u2019s again.\n\nMy sister and I sure are different. It\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019re related. I never get awards. Okay, I\u2019ve gotten a few awards, but they were for my artwork. I\u2019m proud of the awards, and my parents are, too, I think, but Janine just stands out when it comes to schoolwork. Maybe I should tell you a little about my family so you can understand things better.\n\nTo begin with, there are four people in my family \u2014 Mom, Dad, Janine, and me. Janine is sixteen and a junior at Stoneybrook High School, otherwise known as SHS. (We live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut.) I am thirteen and in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School, or SMS. There used to be a fifth person in our family \u2014 my grandmother Mimi. Mimi and I were very close. I could tell her anything. She always listened to me, and she didn\u2019t care that I\u2019m not such a hot student. She really liked my art, too. But now Mimi is gone. She died a little while ago. I miss her a lot.\n\nOur family is Japanese-American. Janine and I were born right here in Stoneybrook, though. We\u2019ve never even been to Japan. My dad is a partner in an investment firm in Stamford, which is a city nearby. My mom is the head librarian at our local public library. I\u2019m stupid and Janine is a genius. Oh, okay. I know that isn\u2019t true. I mean, about my being stupid. According to my teachers I\u2019m very smart. I just don\u2019t apply myself. I have a little trouble concentrating, and frankly, school doesn\u2019t interest me. But art does. I love everything about art. And I\u2019m good at it. I can sculpt, paint, sketch, make collages and jewelry, you name it. I\u2019m not bragging. This is just the way things are.\n\nThen there\u2019s Janine. She doesn\u2019t care about anything except school. She especially likes computers and science. She\u2019s a true and honest genius. She has a genius IQ \u2014 over 150. She\u2019s so smart that even though she\u2019s only in high school, she gets to take some classes at the community college. She\u2019s been doing that for two years now.\n\nJanine and I are as different as night and day.",

Just when everyone was finishing reading the instructions for the \u201cexperiment,\u201d the second hand on the clock hit 1:20.\n\nI jumped up.\n\n\u201cI have to go now,\u201d I reminded my teacher.\n\n\u201cOkay. See you tomorrow, Claudia,\u201d he replied. (It was only Monday, the beginning of a new week of amoebas and paramecia and other biological things.)\n\nI gathered up my stuff, dashed out of the classroom and to my locker, where I put away my science text, took out two other books, and grabbed my jacket. Then I raced to the front of SMS.\n\nMy father was waiting for me.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d I said, as I climbed into his car.\n\n\u201cHi, honey,\u201d he replied.\n\nDad drove through Stoneybrook to the high school. We were going to meet my mother there. I couldn\u2019t believe that both of my parents had left their jobs for this awards ceremony. (Well, Mom was going back to hers afterward, since it\u2019s so close by, but Dad wasn\u2019t. Stamford is too far away.)\n\nWhen we reached the high school, Dad parked our car and we walked to the main entrance of the building. There we found Mom, Peaches, and Russ waiting for us. Peaches and Russ are my aunt and uncle. (Peaches is Mom\u2019s sister.) I love them. They are totally cool and funny. Real characters. Russ is American. I mean, he\u2019s not Japanese. And he\u2019s the one who came up with the name Peaches. See, Mimi gave Mom and Peaches Japanese names, but Russ started calling my aunt Peaches, and it sort of stuck. Now everybody calls her Peaches. And everybody just calls Russ, Russ. Not even Russell, which is his full first name. Janine and I don\u2019t even call them Aunt Peaches and Uncle Russ. They\u2019re Peaches and Russ to the whole world. They don\u2019t have any children (I think maybe they can\u2019t have any), but I wish they did. They would be neat parents.\n\nMom and Dad a",

          "text": "I was so excited I felt like doing cartwheels across Claudia Kishi\u2019s bedroom floor. It was summer (at last!) and my friends and I were gathered for a special meeting of the Baby-sitters Club.\n\nI looked around the room, and it was pretty obvious that my friends were as excited as I was. Of course, everyone was trying very hard to be cool, because that\u2019s the way our club president, Kristy Thomas, expects us to be.\n\nEven though we were starting our summer vacations, she insisted on business as usual. Kristy was perched in a director\u2019s chair, wearing a red T-shirt, faded jeans, and a visor. She glanced at her watch just as our two junior officers, Mallory Pike and Jessi Ramsey, scooted into the room and flopped down on the floor.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Kristy said sternly.\n\nJessi and Mal are younger than the rest of us (and happen to be best friends) but Kristy believes that rules are rules. She takes her duty as president very seriously and believes that nothing \u2014 short of an earthquake \u2014 is an excuse for being late. But I can understand why she feels that way. The Baby-sitters Club was her idea, and I can still remember the day she told Claudia and me about it. All of us had grown up together on Bradford Court and loved to baby-sit, but it took someone like Kristy to set the wheels in motion for an actual sitting business.\n\nBut back to Mal and Jessi. \u201cSorry,\u201d they murmured in unison. They looked like they were trying hard not to giggle. Mal and Jessi always stick together, and besides, how could anyone take things seriously on the first day of summer?\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to California tonight,\u201d I whispered to Dawn Schafer. Dawn is my stepsister (her mother married my father), and she was going to the West Coast to visit her father and brother for two weeks.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it, either. It will be so much fun to go home. I mean, to my second home,\u201d she added quickly.\n\nHer second home? I guess I should explain that. Even though she lives in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, now, Dawn is a California girl at heart. She loves the sun and the ocean, and is into health food in a major way. She even looks like someone out of a California beach movie. If you\u2019ve already guessed that she\u2019s blonde, blue-eyed, and has the kind of dazzling smile you see in toothpaste commercials \u2014 you\u2019re right! Besides being my stepsister, Dawn is my \u201cother\u201d best friend. (Kristy Thomas is also my best friend.) There was definitely some jealousy involved when Dawn and I became stepsisters. Kristy seemed hurt that Dawn and I were spending so much time together, and I had to reassure her that it wouldn\u2019t affect our friendship.\n\nI just realized I haven\u2019t told you who I am, so here\u2019s a capsule biography, as my English teacher would say. My name is Mary Anne Spier. I am thirteen years old and an eighth-grader at Stoneybrook Middle School. I don\u2019t have a yard of wheat-colored hair like Dawn. Instead, I have brown hair, brown eyes, and think of myself as kind of ordinary. Oh, yes, one more thing. I have a fantastic gray kitten named Tigger.\n\n\u201cHave you said good-bye to Logan?\u201d Dawn asked in a low voice.\n\n\u201cI called him last night.\u201d\n\nI knew it would be hard to say good-bye to Logan, so I had decided to get it over with quickly. Logan Bruno is my boyfriend, but I still have a little trouble getting used to the idea. Logan is the cutest boy I have ever seen. He looks just like Cam Geary, my favorite TV star, and he comes from Louisville, Kentucky. He has this smooth southern accent and a voice that makes me think of warm molasses. Logan is an associate member of the BSC, which means he doesn\u2019t come to meetings, but he fills in occasionally when all the regular members are busy. (Our other associate member is Shannon Kilbourne, a friend of Kristy\u2019s.)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really going to miss you,\u201d Dawn said softly. \u201cBut I guess the feeling is mutual.\u201d\n\nI nodded. Even though I had a wonderful two weeks at Sea City, this fantastic beach in New Jersey, ahead of me, I knew I would miss Logan. A lot.\n\n\u201cCan we please come to order?\u201d Kristy said abruptly. I glanced around the room as the meeting began. It\u2019s amazing how many good things have happened for me because of the Baby-sitters Club. Dawn feels the same way. When we became friends, which was right after she moved here from California, I talked the BSC members into letting her join the club. About a year later we became stepsisters. But you\u2019re probably wondering how the club got started, and this would be a good time to tell you a little bit about it.\n\nOne day Kristy noticed that her mom was having a terrible time trying to find a sitter for David Michael, Kristy\u2019s little brother. Kristy couldn\u2019t sit for him, and neither could her two older brothers. So Mrs. Thomas was making calls all over town and getting nowhere. Then Kristy had a great idea. Why not form a baby-sitters club to solve that kind of problem?\n\nThis is how it works. A group of us meet on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 5:30 to 6:00 in Claudia Kishi\u2019s bedroom. Why did we pick Claudia\u2019s room? Because she has her own phone and her own private number. Anyone who wants a baby-sitter can call us at that time, and they immediately reach seven sitters at once. The idea is perfect \u2014 and so simple, we wondered why we hadn\u2019t thought of it before.\n\nKristy is the president, because the club was her idea, and Claudia is the vice-president, since her room is our headquarters. Stacey McGill likes numbers, so she\u2019s our treasurer. My stepsister, Dawn, is our official alternate officer. Dawn has to be familiar with the job of every club officer and be able to substitute for anyone who can\u2019t make a meeting. She really likes being an alternate because she gets to take on lots of different roles in the club.\n\nMal and Jessi are junior officers as I mentioned. Since they are eleven years old, they can only baby-sit after school and on weekends, but they are very responsible. (They don\u2019t have actual club duties, though.) Mal and Jessi have a lot in common",

          "text": "As the train started up, I sat back in my seat, leaned my head against the window, and smiled to myself. On the surface it might seem as if I, eighth\u2011grader Stacey McGill, had the perfect life. Most of the time I live in lovely old Stoneybrook, Connecticut. That\u2019s where my train was headed. I go to a great school, have tons of friends, and belong to the best club in the world \u2014 but more about that later.\n\nEvery now and then, though \u2014 pretty much whenever I feel like it \u2014 I get to go on a \u201cFun\u2011Filled Action\u2011Packed All\u2011Expenses\u2011Paid Weekend in the Glamorous Big Apple, New\u202fYork City!\u201d as they say on the game shows.\n\nThat\u2019s how it looks on the surface. And, I\u2019ll admit, I had just had a terrific weekend in New\u202fYork. But as soon as you peek beneath the surface of my life, you\u2019ll see that it isn\u2019t quite as ideal as it looks. Maybe you\u2019ve guessed by now that the reason I go back and forth between Stoneybrook and New\u202fYork is that my parents are divorced. When they broke up, my mom and I moved to Stoneybrook, and my dad stayed in the city. The split happened pretty recently, and believe me, it was not Fun\u2011Filled, although it was kind of Action\u2011Packed. Before they split up, my parents fought a lot \u2014 not physically or anything, but all that yelling really got to me.\n\nHow did my mom and I end up in Stoneybrook? Well, that\u2019s kind of complicated, but here goes. I grew up in New\u202fYork City, and in a way I\u2019ll always consider it my home. I love all the excitement. I also love eating out, going to shows, and \u2026 shopping! There\u2019s no place like New\u202fYork for great clothes. I still shop there, which means I look pretty sophisticated in Stoneybrook. For example, I had dressed for my train ride in a white jumpsuit, layered over a blue tank top. I had on white push\u2011down socks with blue hearts all over them, a wide blue patent leather belt, and a wild necklace made of all kinds of plastic sea creatures in a rainbow of colors.\n\nOops. I think I got off the track there a little. Where was I? Okay, so I grew up in New\u202fYork, but then when I was in seventh grade my dad\u2019s company transferred him to their Connecticut office. And then, a year later, just as I\u2019d really begun to feel at home in Stoneybrook, they transferred him back to New\u202fYork. Can you believe it?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after we\u2019d moved back to the city that I noticed how my parents seemed to be fighting all the time. And you can guess the rest of the story. They decided to get divorced, I decided to move back to Stoneybrook with my mom (instead of moving to the Upper East Side with my dad), and that\u2019s why I was on that train, thinking about my weekend in New\u202fYork.",

          "text": "The first great thing about the weekend was that my dad had taken the whole day off on Saturday just to be with me. I know, you\u2019re thinking, What\u2019s the big deal? Nobody works on Saturday. Nobody except my dad. I guess he\u2019s what you\u2019d call a workaholic. That was one of the things he and my mom used to fight about: how his job was more important to him than his family, how he was never home\u2026. But on this Saturday, I guess it was important to him to show me a good time, because that\u2019s what he did.\n\nWe started the day by going out to brunch, to this little caf\u00e9 I\u2019ve always loved. All the waiters are really cute, and you can get any kind of omelette you want. The food is excellent, but what I really love is the cappuccino. (That\u2019s coffee with foamy hot milk in it and cinnamon sprinkled on top. Yum.) I\u2019m not usually allowed to drink coffee, but my dad always lets me have a little of his cappuccino.\n\nAfter brunch we just walked around for awhile, window shopping and people watching. You never know who or what you\u2019ll see in New\u202fYork. At one point, as we were crossing Fifth Avenue, I looked to my right just in time to see Gary Rockman (he is the hottest \u2014 and most gorgeous \u2014 star around right now) jump into a cab. I nearly died!\n\nMy dad knows that one of my favorite stores is Fiorucci, so when we got near it he suggested that we go in. He told me to pick out anything I wanted. For a second, I considered taking him at his word and asking him to buy me this outrageous purple suede jacket. Was it beautiful! Cropped short at the waist and covered with fringe all up the arms and across the back. But I did the mature thing (silly me!) and picked out a wild pair of sunglasses \u2014 heart\u2011shaped ones, in a black\u2011and\u2011white checkerboard pattern. Claudia (my best friend in Stoneybrook) will love them, I know.\n\nWe walked and shopped some more, and by 5:00 we were starving, so we decided to go out for dinner. Dad let me choose the restaurant, so I picked Hunan Supreme, this Chinese place in our old neighborhood. We know the owner there, Mr. Lee, and the food is great.\n\nOur meal was delicious, but I have to say that dinner was not my favorite part of the weekend.",

I\u2019m a diabetic. I have to be really careful about what I eat, when I eat it, and how many calories it has. If I\u2019m not careful, my blood sugar gets all out of whack, and I can get seriously ill. I also have to take insulin every day. I give myself the shots, which sounds horrible, but it really is no big deal once you get used to it. When I first got diabetes, my parents were constantly fussing over me. They made me nuts. But by now they basically know that I know how to take care of myself.\n\nUnfortunately, though, I\u2019d recently been told by my regular doctor that I\u2019d have to be even more careful with my diet and with taking just the right amount of insulin. I guess my body is going through some changes right now that make it hard for everything to stay in balance.\n\nSo there I was, about to take another bite of my noodles. I do know that they\u2019re okay for me to eat, of course; otherwise I\u2019d never have ordered them. Who wants to g",

          "text": "Usually my mom comes to get me, but that day I waited and waited. Finally, fifteen minutes after everyone else had left, my dad drove up. He works in Stamford, but my lessons usually end long before he\u2019s ready to leave the office.\n\nI ran to his car.\n\n\"Daddy!\" I cried. \"How come you\u2019re picking me up? Where\u2019s Mama? Did something happen to Becca or Squirt?\"\n\nBecca is my younger sister. She\u2019s eight. Squirt is my baby brother. His real name is John Philip Ramsey, Jr., but since he was the smallest baby in the hospital when he was born, the nurses started calling him Squirt. And the name stuck, even though now Squirt is the same size as most other toddlers his age.\n\nDaddy smiled at me. \"Don\u2019t worry,\" he said, as I slid into the front seat of the car. \"Everyone\u2019s fine. I decided to leave work early today, so I called your mother and told her I\u2019d bring you home. It would be silly for her to make the trip when I\u2019m already here.\"\n\n\"Why\u2019d you leave early?\" I wanted to know. And just then a smell (well, not a smell; a wonderful chocolaty aroma) drifted to me. I turned around and saw a white bakery box on the backseat. \"Hey, what\u2019s that?\"\n\n\"You\u2019re certainly full of questions today,\" remarked Daddy. \"Let\u2019s see. I left early because we have something to celebrate tonight, and the box in the backseat is part of the celebration.\"\n\n\"A celebration? Oh, goody!\" I cried, reaching for the box.\n\n\"No peeking,\" said Daddy.\n\n\"But I want to see what\u2019s in there.\"\n\n\"The celebration is a surprise. You\u2019ll find out all about it after dinner.\"\n\nI couldn\u2019t help guessing. \"You got a promotion!\" I exclaimed.\n\nDaddy shook his head.\n\n\"You got a raise.\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re moving back to New Jersey?\"\n\nI wasn\u2019t quite as excited by that idea. The funny thing is, a few months ago, I would have jumped at the chance to leave Stoneybrook and return to Oakley, New Jersey, the town in which I grew up. My family and I had been happy there. We are black, and our neighborhood, school, and even my ballet school in Oakley were all mixed up \u2014 black people and white people, living and working together. Plus, my relatives lived nearby. One of my cousins, Keisha, was my best friend. When Daddy\u2019s company offered him a better job in Stamford, he jumped at the chance. But it meant we had to move. I did not want to leave Oakley. But I was not prepared for what would greet us in Stoneybrook \u2014 prejudice, that\u2019s what. We moved to a town with only a few black residents. I am the only black student in the entire sixth grade. People teased my family. People said nasty things to us. People ignored us.\n\nAt first.\n\nSlowly, though, a change came about. I made some friends. They became good friends. Becca and I each made a best friend. Now I can\u2019t see going back to Oakley. I\u2019d have to leave too many memories behind \u2014 like my baby-sitting adventures. Or the time our whole school went on a trip to a ski lodge in Vermont. Or the time my friends and I went to summer camp.\n\nBut luckily Daddy said, \"No, we\u2019re not moving.\"\n\nThen it struck me. \"You\u2019re having a baby, aren\u2019t you? You and Mama are having a baby! Oh, I hope it\u2019s another boy. Then our family would be even. Two girls, two boys.\"\n\nDadddy chuckled. \"It\u2019s not a new baby, either,\" he said. \"And why don\u2019t you stop guessing? I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll give it away if you really do guess it.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, but I continued guessing in my head. We had won the lottery. We were taking a trip to Disney World \u2014 or maybe even Texas. I had always wanted to see Texas. Then I got another idea. I bet Mama and Daddy really were having a baby, but Daddy was too smart to let on.\n\nAll the way to Stoneybrook, I hugged the secret to myself.",

          "text": "But back to the story. I glanced around Kristy Thomas\u2019s bedroom and saw that all six of my friends were experimenting with lipstick and nail polish. A few of them, like Stacey McGill, were even trying out new hairstyles. It was a sort of mass \u201cmake-over,\u201d and there was a lot of giggling going on. (And some of the \u201cbefores\u201d looked better than the \u201cafters,\u201d if you know what I mean.)\n\nI guess I should stop here and introduce everybody before I tell you anything else about the sleepover at Kristy\u2019s. First of all, the seven of us are members of the Baby-sitters Club (or BSC), which I\u2019ll explain about later. My name is Dawn Schafer, and I am the alternate officer of the club. I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, and I am thirteen years old. My friends all say I look like a California girl with my long blonde hair and sparkly blue eyes. This makes sense since I lived in California before my parents got divorced and my mom and my brother Jeff and I moved to Stoneybrook. Now Jeff lives in California again with my father (he just wasn\u2019t happy in Connecticut), and sometimes I go back to visit. What else would you like to know? Well, I love the outdoors, I\u2019m a vegetarian, and I try to eat a healthy diet. (Unlike Claudia, who thinks Gummi Bears are nature\u2019s perfect food.)\n\nClaudia is a beautiful, dramatic-looking Japanese-American who loves exotic clothes. (She\u2019s also the vice-president of the BSC.) Claudia\u2019s one of those people who can wear anything and get away with it. Today, for example, she had stuck to two colors: black and white. Black cotton bib overalls over a white turtleneck with a shiny black patent leather belt looped around her waist. Black suede ankle boots and white cotton socks. Long black hair swept off her face with giant white plastic barrettes. Anyone else would look like a penguin in that get-up, but Claudia looked great.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked, holding up a white hoop earring next to her face. \u201cToo much?\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cMaybe just a little.\u201d The earring was the size of a doorknob.\n\n\u201cHey, Dawn, will you take a look at my hair?\u201d asked Mary Anne. Mary Anne Spier is my stepsister (my mother married Richard, her father) and she is also my best friend. Mary Anne is a lot less daring with clothes and makeup than I am, but she has grown up quite a bit in the past year.\n\nWhen I first met Mary Anne, she looked like a little girl. She was wearing little-girl clothes and, worst of all, she was wearing her brown hair in two long pigtails. Awful! When I got to know her better, I realized that she\u2019s really sweet and very sensitive, and that she dressed that way because her father picked out her clothes. See, Mary Anne\u2019s mother died when Mary Anne was just a baby, so her father has always been very protective of her. Luckily, he\u2019s loosened up a lot since he married my mom, and Mary Anne looks like a regular thirteen-year-old now. And she even has a steady boyfriend. She\u2019s the only one of us BSC members who can make that claim. Her boyfriend is named Logan Bruno, and he\u2019s part of the club, too. Mary Anne is the club secretary.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d I asked, scooting over to her side of the room. The minute the words were out of my mouth, I knew the answer.\n\nStacey McGill (a real New York girl) was busily \u201cscrunching\u201d Mary Anne\u2019s long brown hair into a tangled mane that trailed down her back. Very hip, very in, but not very \u201cMary Anne.\u201d I thought it looked fantastic, but I knew that Mary Anne was unhappy with it. Mary Anne usually wears her hair in a smooth style; she\u2019s used to seeing herself in a certain way. (I should explain that Mary Anne would never complain to Stacey, because she doesn\u2019t like to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings.)\n\n\u201cHonestly, Mary Anne, if you\u2019d just keep your hands out of the way, this would go a lot quicker.\u201d Stacey had scrunched her own hair into a cloud of blonde curls and was trying for the same effect with my stepsister.\n\nMary Anne shot me a desperate look in the mirror, just as Stacey gave a final pat to her hair and said pointedly, \u201cDoesn\u2019t she look great?\u201d\n\nI was on the spot. \u201cI think it\u2019s a nice change,\u201d I began. \u201cOf course, you wouldn\u2019t have to wear it that way every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe should. It\u2019s a big improvement,\u201d Stacey said flatly. Stacey McGill, the club treasurer, is very fashion-conscious and always wears the newest, trendiest clothes. She is sophisticated, like Claudia (who happens to be her best friend), and she has boyfriends sometimes, but no steady ones. She\u2019s an only child and grew up in New York City until her father\u2019s company transferred him to Connecticut. The McGills had lived in Stoneybrook for a year when her father was sent back to New York. We all said tearful good-byes to Stacey and wondered if we would ever see her again. About a year later, Stacey\u2019s parents got divorced, and Stacey and her mom returned to Connecticut. Talk about a complicated life! Stacey still seems like a New York girl at heart (just like I am a California girl at heart) and she visits her father in New York whenever she can.\n\nJust to add to Stacey\u2019s problems, she has a sever",

Then I raised my voice. \u201cKeep your eye on the ball!\u201d I yelled.\n\nI must have startled Jackie Rodowsky because he swung way too low and missed an easy pitch.\n\n\u201cStrike two!\u201d shouted the umpire.\n\n\u201cDarn,\u201d I muttered. I went back to murmuring, \u201cConcentrate, concentrate.\u201d\n\nIt was almost the end of another game between the Krushers and the Bashers. Who are the Krushers and the Bashers? They\u2019re softball teams here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I am the coach of the Krushers. Bart Taylor is the coach of the Bashers.\n\nI have a crush on Bart.\n\nAnyway, for the first time in the history of softball games between my Krushers and Bart\u2019s Bashers, it looked like the Krushers had a chance to win. See, the Krushers are not your average softball team. The players are all kids who are too young or too scared to try out for T-ball or Little League. In other words, as you might have guessed, they aren\u2019t great players. (Well, most of them aren\u2019t.) One kid ducks every time a ball comes toward him. Most of the kids are not good hitters. We even have one player who\u2019s only two and a half years old. We let her use a special ball and bat so she doesn\u2019t get hurt, and we have to tell her everything to do. But you know what? She\u2019s a pretty good hitter for her age.\n\nBart\u2019s Bashers, on the other hand, are an older, tougher group of kids. (I don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t just join Little League. Maybe they like having Bart as their coach. I could certainly understand that.) The thing is, the Bashers have always beaten the Krushers easily.\n\nUntil now.\n\nNow the score was tied, the Krushers had been playing very well, the bases were loaded, and it was the bottom of the ninth \u2014 with two outs. The only problem was that the Krushers were up, and our batter was Jackie Rodowsky, the walking disaster. Poor Jackie. I love him to bits, but he is a walking disaster. He\u2019s accident\u2011prone, he has bad luck, and he\u2019s not too coordinated.\n\nThe pitcher looked nervous, though. After all, the game was tied, and the Bashers had never been beaten by the Krushers.\n\nStill, this was the walking disaster at bat. \u201cCome on, come on,\u201d I muttered, and gave Jackie the thumbs\u2011up sign.\n\nThe pitcher threw the ball, Jackie swung his bat, and \u2014 he hit a home run! Four more runs.\n\n\u201cWe won! We won!\u201d the Krushers screamed.\n\nI screamed right along with them, even though I knew the Bashers had been playing under handicaps. Their best hitter had the chicken pox, their usual pitcher was out of town for the weekend, and two good players had been benched for fighting (with each other).\n\nStill, the Krushers were victorious, and our cheerleaders went wild. \u201cWe won! We won! We won!\u201d they couldn\u2019t stop yelling. Then they remembered their softball manners and shouted, \u201cTwo, four, six, eight! Who do we appreciate? The Bashers! The Bashers! Yea!\u201d\n\nI had a feeling this was the first time our cheerleaders actually meant what they were saying.\n\nOur cheerleaders, by the way, are Vanessa Pike and Haley Braddock, who are nine, and Charlotte Johanssen, who\u2019s eight. Haley\u2019s brother, Matt, is a Krusher. He\u2019s profoundly deaf, but he\u2019s one of our best players. We communicate with him using sign language. Several of Vanessa\u2019s brothers and sisters (she has seven) are on the team, including her littlest sister, Claire, who\u2019s five and sometimes throws tantrums, shouting, \u201cNofe\u2011air! Nofe\u2011air! Nofe\u2011air!\u201d when she thinks she\u2019s been wronged.",

Honest.\u201d And, \u201cWe finally won a game!\u201d\n\nThen I looked across the schoolyard to where my big brother Charlie was waiting to drive me and my little brothers and sister home. (Charlie is seventeen, can drive, and has this awful old secondhand car. At least it runs.)\n\nWho am I? I\u2019m Kristy Thomas. I\u2019m thirteen and I\u2019m an eighth\u2011grader at Stoneybrook Middle School (SMS). I have three brothers, a stepbrother and stepsister, and an adopted sister. David Michael, my seven\u2011year\u2011old brother, and Karen and Andrew, my stepsister and stepbrother, who are seven and four, are Krushers. Charlie was going to drop Karen and Andrew off at their mother\u2019s house and then take David Michael and me home. This was nice of him. We could have walked, but we had an awful lot of equipment.\n\nCharlie and I were just loading the last of it into the back of his car, when a voice said, \u201cCan I walk you home?\u201d I whirled around. It was Bart. My heart flip\u2011flopped. It actually felt like it turned over inside my chest. I tried to breathe slowly.\n\n\u201cCharlie?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs that okay with you? You can leave the stuff in the car and I\u2019ll help you unload it as soon as I get home.\u201d\n\nNo problem,\u201d replied Charlie. (He is so good\u2011natured.) \u201cOkay, see you later, David Michael. Karen and Andrew, I\u2019ll see you Friday afternoon.\u201d (Karen and Andrew only live with their dad and my mom and the rest of our family every other weekend. Oh, and for two weeks during the summer. The rest of the time they live with their mother and stepfather.)\n\n\u201c\u2019Bye!\u201d called David Michael, Karen and Andrew, who were still practically hysterical over beating the Bashers.\n\nCharlie drove off in his rattly car.",

I have long black hair and almond\u2011shaped eyes (I\u2019m Japanese\u2011American) and in case you haven\u2019t already figured it out, I\u2019m not what you would call a scholar. In fact, the test I was studying for was in remedial math. That\u2019s right. I can\u2019t seem to keep up with the rest of my class, at least in certain subjects. I try hard, but maybe not hard enough. The fact is, I\u2019m just not too crazy about things like math and science.\n\nWhat am I crazy about? I\u2019ll tell you. First on my list is art. I love drawing, painting, sculpting, making things out of papier\u2011m\u00e2ch\u00e9, making collages, making jewelry \u2026 well, you get the picture.\n\nNext, I love my family. We\u2019re pretty close. There\u2019s just Mom and Dad and Janine and me. My dad\u2019s an investment banker, my mom\u2019s a librarian, and my sister, Janine, is a genius. I mean it! She\u2019s a junior at Stoneybrook High, but she\u2019s taking college courses already. It\u2019s, well, it\u2019s interesting to have a genius in the family. More about Janine later.\n\nMimi, the one in the picture, was my grandmother. (Of course she wasn\u2019t my grandmother yet when that picture was taken.) She died not long ago, but I love that photo of her as a young girl. She looked a lot like me way back then.\n\nI miss Mimi all the time. How can I explain how wonderful she was? Always calm, always gentle \u2014 that was Mimi. She understood me better than anyone else ever has. Sometimes I just can\u2019t believe that I\u2019ll really never see her again. But she\u2019ll always be in my heart, and just thinking of her and looking at her picture can make me feel close to her.",

          "text": "Now, where was I? Oh, right. Things that I\u2019m crazy about. Well, I love to baby\u2011sit \u2014 so much so that I belong to a club called the Baby\u2011sitters Club \u2014 but more about that later, too. I also love to read Nancy Drew mysteries, and I adore junk food. Doritos, M&M\u2019s, Twinkies \u2014 I never say no to any of it.\n\nMy parents, however, don\u2019t like me to read Nancy Drew books (they would prefer that I read \u201cclassics\u201d) and they really don\u2019t like me to eat junk food. (\u201cProper nutrition is important \u2026\u201d You know the line.)\n\nSo I\u2019ve learned to hide my secret vices. The Nancy Drew books get stuck under my mattress, or on the top shelf of my closet, or underneath a pile of dirty clothes. The junk food gets stashed anywhere and everywhere \u2014 it\u2019s always turning up where I least expect it. Last night, for example, when I was looking for my favorite watercolor set, I found a box of Milk Duds that I had hidden about three months ago. (They were still good.)\n\nOn this night, though, I wasn\u2019t eating any junk food or reading Nancy Drew books. I was studying for a big test, a huge test, a killer test. This math test was going to count for a big part of my final grade. I just had to do well on it.\n\nJanine was helping me study. It\u2019s kind of a rule in my family (my parents\u2019 idea) that somebody has to help me with my homework every night. Mimi used to be my favorite helper of all. She never got impatient with me, she never made me feel dumb, and even though she didn\u2019t often tell me so, I always knew that she was very, very proud of whatever I did.\n\nJanine is a different story.\n\nIt\u2019s not that she\u2019s mean or anything \u2014 but I just don\u2019t think she has any idea of what school is like for me. See, she loves school. She\u2019d go to school eight days a week if she could. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever gotten any grade lower than an A\u2013. And you should see the classes she takes! I don\u2019t even understand the names of most of them \u2014 especially the computer ones.\n\nAnd here she is, helping me try to understand how Gertrude measures chocolate \u2014 and why. She must think I\u2019m so dumb. I know it\u2019s really nice of her to help me, but I sure wish I didn\u2019t need her \u2014 or anyone\u2019s \u2014 help.\n\nI looked back at my math book. All those fractions were kind of making me dizzy. Janine was being unusually patient. She knew this test was important to me.\n\n\u201cSo how do you like Mr. Zorzi, Claudia?\u201d she asked. Mr. Zorzi is my math teacher \u2014 at least he is for now. See, my regular teacher is out for a few weeks, recovering from an operation, so we have Mr. Zorzi as a long\u2011term substitute.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s okay, I guess. I\u2019ve had him before. He knows it takes me awhile to catch on to some of this stuff,\u201d I said, nodding toward my messy notebook.\n\nFrankly, I never think too much about my teachers and whether I like them or not. I just do my best to get through most of my classes without making a total fool of myself. Janine, however, just loves some of her teachers \u2014 and all of them think that she\u2019s the greatest.\n\nSometimes I get so tired of teachers asking me, \u201cClaudia Kishi? Are you Janine\u2019s sister? Well, I know I can expect some wonderful work from you, if you\u2019re anything like Janine.\u201d Of course, they\u2019re always disappointed. Except my art teachers.

          "text": "\"How do I look?\" I asked.\n\n\"Look? You look just fine,\" replied Dawn. \"Anyway, you\u2019re only going to baby\u2011sit for Jenny. What\u2019s the big deal?\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know. I guess Mrs. Prezzioso is the big deal. You know how she\u2019s always dressed. And how she always dresses Jenny.\"\n\n\"Yeah. They look like contestants in a mother\u2011daughter beauty pageant.\"\n\nDawn and I giggled. Dawn is not only one of my two best friends; she\u2019s my stepsister. It was a Friday night and I was getting ready to sit for Jenny. Dawn was perched on a chair in my room.\n\n\"You know what?\" I went on. \"Mrs. P. has only gotten worse since she found out she\u2019s going to have another baby.\"\n\n\"I can\u2019t believe that we know what the baby is going to be, and the rest of the BSC members don\u2019t. They don\u2019t even want to know, Mary Anne.\"\n\n\"They want to be surprised, that\u2019s all,\" I said.\n\n(BSC stands for the Baby\u2011sitters Club. Dawn and I and a bunch of our friends belong to it. I\u2019ll tell you about it later.)\n\nWho am I? I\u2019m Mary Anne Spier. I live in an old (very old) farmhouse with Dawn, my father, and Dawn\u2019s mother. In case you\u2019re wondering, Dawn and I have been friends longer than we\u2019ve been stepsisters. After our parents got married, Dad and I and my kitten, Tigger, moved into Dawn\u2019s house. That\u2019s because it\u2019s bigger than my old house was. Since we\u2019re pretty new at being a family, I call Dawn\u2019s mother Sharon, and Dawn calls my father Richard. That feels more comfortable than Mom and Dad. All things considered, our family is coming together pretty well. We have our tough times (what family doesn\u2019t?), but the good times are getting to be more frequent, and they last longer.\n\nLet\u2019s see. I have brown hair, brown eyes, and a boyfriend! His name is Logan Bruno. Sometimes it\u2019s hard for me to believe I have a boyfriend. That\u2019s for two reasons: 1. I\u2019m really shy. I bet I\u2019m the shyest eighth\u2011grader at Stoneybrook Middle School. 2. For awhile now, Logan and I haven\u2019t been getting along all that well. We\u2019ve hit a few rough patches. There was the time when Dawn, Claudia (another BSC member), and four kids went on a sailing trip and got stranded on a little island off the coast. (It\u2019s a long story.) Practically everyone here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, was looking for them or worrying about them. (I was a worrier. I wanted to be a searcher, but I have very fair skin, so I can\u2019t stay out in the sun too long.) Anyway, right before the sailing accident, Logan and I had a fight. It was a big one, but it was over the smallest thing. I learned something from that fight. I learned that Logan and I don\u2019t always trust each other. And I learned that Logan can\u2019t always be counted on in a crisis. He wasn\u2019t there when I needed him the most. I thought he could put our fight aside while our friends were lost at sea. But he couldn\u2019t, or didn\u2019t, until just before the end of the crisis.\n\nWe did make up after that, but it hasn\u2019t been our only fight. We had a pretty good one during another crisis \u2014 when Tigger was missing. Tigger is little! He\u2019s just a bundle of soft, gray, tiger\u2011striped fur and a lot of purrs. He could have been in big trouble (although it turned out he wasn\u2019t). So while he was missing, I was scared to death \u2014 and Logan and I weren\u2019t getting along.\n\nLogan and I have had some other difficult times, too. This is hard to believe, since everything was so great when we first met and realized we liked each other. For one thing, I couldn\u2019t fathom that a boy even liked me. I was shy, mousy Mary Anne. And Logan was this drop\u2011dead handsome guy. He looks exactly like my favorite star, Cam Geary. Plus, he\u2019s from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has a wonderful Southern drawl. Everyone loves the way he sounds. Yet Logan chose me for his girlfriend. We\u2019ve given each other gifts, gone to school dances together, and been out on dates. Plus, Logan was with me the day I chose Tigger at the animal shelter.\n\nSo Logan and I started off with a great relationship. But lately he\u2019s been a little pushy. At least, that\u2019s the way it seems to me. Sometimes I wonder if I\u2019m falling out of love with Logan, but I don\u2019t think so. Not over a few tiffs and misunderstandings.\n\n\"So, anyway,\" I said to my stepsister, \"do I look nice enough for Her Highness?\"\n\n\"Like a real princess,\" Dawn answered, even though I was just wearing jeans and a new baggy sweater. \"Go find your crown and you\u2019ll be all set.\"\n\nI laughed. Then I checked my watch. \"I better get going,\" I said. \"I\u2019m supposed to be there in twenty minutes.\"\n\nThe phone rang then, and Dawn said, \"I\u2019ll get it. You find your crown.\"",

          "text": "\"And now, mademoiselles, if you please: a pas de bourr\u00e9e couru, en cinqui\u00e8me, with port de bras, ending in an arabesque. One at a time, please \u2026 and begin!\" Mme Noelle banged her stick on the floor to emphasize her words.\n\nA stranger might have thought they\u2019d wandered into some other world \u2014 and in a way, they\u2019d be right. A ballet studio is another world \u2014 a world where movement is everything, and where words are shorthand for what our bodies should be doing.\n\nPah deh boure-ay koo-roo? On sank-eeyem? With por deh brah? And an ara-besk? Sounds crazy, but what Mme Noelle, our teacher, wanted us to do was to move on our toes across the floor, holding our arms in graceful patterns, and end by standing on one toe with our arms held out to the sides. That\u2019s what all those words meant. They\u2019re French.\n\nI don\u2019t speak French, but I know those words, and a lot of others, because French is the language of ballet, and I\u2019ve been studying ballet since I was four. I\u2019m eleven now, so that\u2019s a long time!\n\n\"Jessica Romsey, please take your turn!\" said Mme Noelle.\n\nJessica Romsey, that\u2019s me. Except most people call me Jessi, and my last name\u2019s Ramsey, not Romsey. It\u2019s just that elegant accent of Mme Noelle\u2019s; everything comes out sounding kind of \u2014 well, kind of fancy.\n\nI closed my eyes for a second, picturing what I was about to do. I wanted to do the best pas de bourr\u00e9e I\u2019d ever done. Why? Because this was the final stage in the final auditions for a big production that was going to be put on by my ballet school. We were going to be putting on The Sleeping Beauty. And I was trying out for the lead!\n\nI took a deep breath, let it out slowly, and rose onto my toes. Then I began. I was so focused that I was hardly aware of Mme Noelle\u2019s attention, but I knew she was watching every single muscle in my body, checking to make sure that I was in complete control.\n\nNormally, as I bourr\u00e9e\u2019d past her, Madame would be making comments like, \u201cLong neck, Mademoiselle Romsey!\u201d or, \u201cUse zee onkles!\u201d (That\u2019s \u201cankles,\u201d just in case you were wondering.) But this wasn\u2019t a class. This was an audition. And I was on my own.\n\nI finished the bourr\u00e9e and went into an arabesque, stretching my arms gracefully (I hoped). Then I clomped off the stage area, my toe shoes clacking with every step.\n\nI watched the other girls do what I\u2019d done, one at a time. There are a lot of good dancers in my class, which makes sense \u2014 it is, after all, an advanced class. Take Mary Bramstedt, for example. Right then she was bourr\u00e9e-ing across the floor, in perfect form. She always seems to be in perfect form. But I think (and this is just my personal opinion \u2014 I\u2019d never say it out loud) that there\u2019s something missing when she dances. Something like \u2014 I know this might sound really silly but \u2014 passion. She\u2019s kind of like a robot, you know?\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone could mistake me for a robot \u2014 and not just because I\u2019m not always in perfect form. As far as I know, there aren\u2019t too many black robots running around \u2014 in fact, there are probably even fewer black robots than there are black ballerinas.\n\nLuckily, there are a few black ballerinas now. Twenty years ago, there weren\u2019t any. And someone like me, with skin the color of cocoa and eyes like coal, could never have dreamed of joining a ballet company. But now I can dream. And it makes me glad, because I absolutely, positively love to dance.\n\nSo does Carrie Steinfeld, and it was showing as she did her bourr\u00e9e. She\u2019s a great dancer \u2014 one of the best in the class. She\u2019s also one of the oldest students in the class, and she\u2019ll be graduating soon. This might be her last chance to get a starring role in a production \u2014 a role that would really give her an edge if she could add it to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nWithout having had a role like Princess Aurora, the leading part in The Sleeping Beauty, Carrie might have a hard time getting into another dance school for older students. And she\u2019d have hardly any chance at all of joining a ballet company. The ballet world is very competitive.\n\n\"Very nice, Mademoiselle Steinfeld,\" said Mme Noelle. I bit my lip. She hadn\u2019t said anything when I finished my bourr\u00e9e. I tried not to worry about it. It might not mean a thing, after all.",

That was not too long ago, when my dad was transferred to the Stamford office of his firm. The move was tough on the whole family.\n\nIt was tough for the usual reasons \u2014 leaving friends and family, coming to a strange new place \u2014 but there were other reasons that made it even worse. The neighborhood we used to live in, in New Jersey, was completely integrated. So were the schools. But in Stoneybrook, it\u2019s different. Here there are very few black families. People just weren\u2019t used to seeing black faces \u2014 and they didn\u2019t make us feel too welcome. In fact, it was the opposite.\n\nBut over time, we\u2019ve all made friends in Stoneybrook, and our lives have settled down. I\u2019d have to say that my family is pretty happy here now. And for me, one of the best parts of the move was getting into this dance school. The school isn\u2019t actually in Stoneybrook \u2014 it\u2019s in Stamford, where my dad\u2019s office is. It\u2019s one of the best on the East Coast \u2014 if you don\u2019t count the really big ones in New York City. And Mme Noelle is known throughout the ballet community as an excellent teacher.

(That was a number of chapters before the one we were already working on.) \u201cThe pluperfect,\u201d I muttered, and began to read.\n\nThe next thing I knew, an announcement was coming over the loudspeaker. \u201cStation stop, Pennington. This is Pennington!\u201d\n\nPennington! That was more than halfway to New York! I\u2019d fallen asleep and had just wasted over an hour\u2019s worth of studying time.\n\nI yawned and stretched. Yechh. I felt awful. No wonder I\u2019d fallen asleep. Maybe I was coming down with something again. Boy \u2026 was I thirsty. Did I have a fever? I didn\u2019t care. All I knew was that I needed something to drink \u2014 desperately. I was opening my change purse when I remembered that the train didn\u2019t have a snack car. Now what was I going to do? Well, I don\u2019t need to have a soda, I told myself. Water will do just fine.\n\nI looked behind me. Thank goodness there was a bathroom on my car. A bathroom would have running water and little paper cups, wouldn\u2019t it?\n\nSort of. I mean, I was half right. The bathroom, which, by the way, didn\u2019t smell so hot, had a sink with nice, cold running water. It even had a bar of dirty pink soap and a stack of paper towels. But there were no cups.\n\nI thought of this silly fold\u2011up plastic cup that Mom used to bring along on vacations \u2014 for situations just like this. I used to tease her about that cup. Now I would have paid her for it.\n\nI stood in the bathroom and thought. The idea of not drinking some water didn\u2019t even occur to me. It was just a question of how to drink it. Finally I decided that there was only one thing to do. Wrinkling my nose, I washed my hands with the dirty soap. I figured that washing my hands with dirty soap was cleaner than not washing them at all. When I finished, I turned off the hot water, cupped my hands under the cold water, and drank \u2026 and drank \u2026 and drank. Ooh. At that moment, nothing \u2014 not even chocolate \u2014 would have tasted as good as that water did.\n\nI went back to my seat.\n\nFive minutes later I was thirsty again.\n\nBy the time I reached Grand Central Station, I had gotten up for drinks of water six more times. (And I had been to the bathroom twice.)",

I didn\u2019t think I could hide it any longer.\n\n\u201cWhat about dinner?\u201d asked Dad.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019ve been starving all day \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d Dad interrupted.\n\n\u201cYes. Breakfast and lunch.\u201d (I didn\u2019t mention the package of M&M\u2019s that I\u2019d sneaked while I was hiding in the girls\u2019 room.) \u201cBut I\u2019m still hungry. The only thing is, I\u2019m tired, too. I\u2019d like to go out to dinner.

We ate dinner in the kitchen, which was much more relaxing than eating out, even at the Sign of the Dove. I changed into jeans, and Dad and I just sat around and talked and ate.\n\nI considered calling Laine, but by nine o\u2019clock I was so relaxed that I yawned and said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll go to bed now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d Dad looked surprised.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m really zonked.\u201d Thirsty, too, but I didn\u2019t say so.\n\nIt was hard to hide this from Dad, though. His apartment is not all that big. There\u2019s only one bathroom, and it\u2019s closer to his bedroom than to mine. So he heard me when I kept getting up all night for drinks of water. (At least Dad\u2019s bathroom has clean soap and my own personal glass.)\n\nOnce during the night, Dad was waiting for me when I came out of the bathroom. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked. \u201cI knew we shouldn\u2019t have ordered from the deli.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, my stomach\u2019s fine,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m still so thirsty. I keep drinking water and then I have to go to the bathroom all the time.\u201d\n\nDad frowned. \u201cWe should check your blood sugar level.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d It was three\u2011thirty. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m falling asleep. Tomorrow.\u201d I made my getaway as quickly as I could.\n\n* * *",

When he couldn\u2019t reach my doctor immediately, he put me in a cab and we rode to the nearest hospital.\n\nSaturday had been a good day for Claud. At least that\u2019s what she said the first time we had a chance to talk after I was admitted to the hospital. The cab had taken Dad and me to one of New York\u2019s finest. However, having been in a number of hospitals, I can tell you that no matter what \u2026 the food stinks. It makes the food in our school cafeteria look \u2014 and taste \u2014 like gourmet dishes prepared by a great chef of the world. In a hospital nowadays, everything that can be is individually wrapped \u2014 a slice of bread in a plastic wrapper, juice in a disposable plastic cup with a foil lid, etc. I would look at my plate after a meal, and it would practically be hidden by a pile of plastic and foil and paper.\n\nWhat a waste.\n\nIf one person in one hospital generates this much trash, I thought, after my first \u201cfactory\u2011fresh\u201d meal, how can our environment possibly deal with it? How can \u2014 Oops. I am way off the track. I\u2019ll tell you about the hospital later. What I started to tell you about was Claudia and her good day. It began with a pottery class.

She\u2019s Japanese-American and totally stunning, with silky black hair, almond\u2011shaped eyes, and a perfect complexion. She\u2019s got a great figure, too, despite the fact that she is a junk food fanatic. You can\u2019t spend two minutes in Claudia\u2019s room without her pulling a Ring\u2011Ding or a Twinkie or a Snickers bar out of some hiding place. She\u2019s got all kinds of art supplies, too, but those are out in the open. Claudia\u2019s main thing (besides junk food) is art. You name it, she can do it well \u2014 painting, drawing, sculpting, jewelry making \u2026 even the way she dresses is artistic. For instance, she walked into school today wearing a bright yellow, oversize man\u2019s jacket with rolled\u2011up sleeves; a wide paisley tie right out of the nineteen\u2011sixties; orange stirrup pants; ankle boots; and huge hoop earrings \u2014 and you know what? On her, it looked totally cool.\n\nOh, another passion of Claud\u2019s is Nancy Drew books. She has them hidden around her room, too, because her parents don\u2019t approve of them. They think she should be reading classics or textbooks, like her sister, Janine. Janine\u2019s a certified genius, with one of the highest IQs anyone\u2019s ever heard of. (She\u2019s the kind of person who finds mistakes in the dictionary.) She and Claudia get along okay, but they couldn\u2019t be more different. Claudia doesn\u2019t do very well in school \u2014 probably because she always feels she can\u2019t compete with Janine. Which is too bad, because Claudia\u2019s really smart.

They both have boyfriends sometimes, although no one steady. But that\u2019s where the similarities end. For one thing, Stacey\u2019s got blonde hair and blue eyes, she\u2019s an only child, and \u2014 here\u2019s the best part \u2014 she\u2019s from New York City! Just like I\u2019m a California girl at heart, Stacey\u2019s a real New Yorker. She has a map of the city on her wall, and something called an alternate\u2011side\u2011of\u2011the\u2011street\u2011parking calendar, with cartoons about car\u2011parking (they\u2019re really dumb, but New Yorkers supposedly find them hilarious). Stacey moved to Stoneybrook when her dad was transferred here (he\u2019s a businessman) \u2014 then, when he was transferred again, she moved back to New York. But less than a year after they settled into a new apartment, her parents told her they were getting a divorce \u2014 and Stacey moved with her mother back to Stoneybrook. She could have chosen to stay in the city, but she didn\u2019t. That was a tough decision for her, but we were thrilled when she came back.\n\nStacey\u2019s life is complicated by one other thing, if you can believe it. She has diabetes. That\u2019s a disease in which your body has trouble controlling the level of sugar in your blood. Stacey has to be on a strict diet for life (meaning no sweets) \u2014 and she has to give herself daily injections of a drug called insulin. To tell you the truth, I still don\u2019t know how she can watch Claudia pull out candy left and right and not go totally crazy.",

I have to say, she is good, and she doesn\u2019t even get stage fright. Jessi is also the BSC\u2019s only black member. The Ramseys are one of the only black families in Stoneybrook, by the way.

          "text": "Oh, my family\u2019s so confusing sometimes. Let me start at the beginning. See, my original family was pretty normal. There were my mom and dad and my two older brothers, Charlie and Sam, me, and my little brother, David Michael.\n\nBut just after David Michael was born, my dad walked out on us. He just left. I hear from him now and then, on my birthday (although sometimes he even forgets that) or at Christmas. I think he\u2019s living somewhere in California these days. It was hard on us when he first left, but my mom\u2019s pretty strong, and she did a great job of holding the family together.\n\nAnd then, not too long ago, my mom met this really terrific guy named Watson Brewer. They fell in love and got married \u2014 so now Watson\u2019s my stepfather. After the wedding, we moved across town to live in his mansion.\n\nWatson is a real, true millionaire. Can you believe it? But you\u2019d never know it by the way he acts \u2014 he\u2019s not stuck up or anything. He\u2019s just a regular guy. And he\u2019s a great father to his two kids from his first marriage \u2014 Karen (she\u2019s seven) and Andrew (he\u2019s almost five). They live with us every other weekend and for a couple of weeks during the summer. They\u2019re terrific kids.\n\nSo anyway, once we moved into the mansion, Mom and Watson started to want a baby \u2014 and that\u2019s where Emily Michelle comes in. When Mom first started talking about a baby, I thought she was planning to get pregnant. But then Watson told us that they were going to adopt a little Vietnamese girl \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what they did.\n\nEmily Michelle is two and a half years old, and she\u2019s just about the most adorable thing I\u2019ve ever seen. She doesn\u2019t talk much \u2014 partly because she\u2019s just beginning to understand English. But she\u2019s a real sweetie.\n\nDavid Michael\u2019s seven now, and he loves being a big brother. Emily Michelle looks up to him just like I look up to Charlie (he\u2019s seventeen) and Sam (he\u2019s fifteen).\n\nI haven\u2019t even mentioned Nannie yet \u2014 she\u2019s my grandmother. She moved in with us after we adopted Emily, partly because we needed her help (Mom and Watson both work) and partly because she was tired of living alone. Her husband died years ago.\n\nNannie\u2019s great. She keeps busy and really enjoys life. She has tons of friends, she likes to bowl, and she\u2019s always on the go.\n\nThere are several other members of my family \u2014 but they\u2019re not people. We\u2019ve got a puppy named Shannon \u2014 she\u2019s a Bernese mountain dog, and she\u2019s going to be huge some day. And Boo\u2011Boo is Watson\u2019s cat. He\u2019s old and fat and kind of mean \u2014 but he\u2019s still part of the family. Plus, Karen and Andrew have two goldfish, Crystal Light the Second and Goldfishie.",

          "text": "Now, where was I? Oh, right. I was telling you how bored we all were that day. Well, you\u2019d be bored, too, after playing Clue, Candy Land, Shark Attack (that\u2019s Emily\u2019s favorite), and one lo\u2011o\u2011ng game of Monopoly.\n\nI racked my brain trying to think of something to do. I wasn\u2019t about to turn on the TV \u2014 I only do that as a last resort \u2014 but I couldn\u2019t come up with any other ideas for indoor activities. I kept wishing that the sun would come out so we could go outside, but it refused to budge from behind all those clouds.\n\nShould we make cookies? Nope. Too messy. Mom would be coming home pretty soon, and she\u2019d want to start dinner. Build with Legos? No way. David Michael had told me early in the afternoon that he was sick of Legos.\n\nI got up to put Shark Attack away, and that\u2019s when it hit me. I saw all the magazines and newspapers sitting in their recycling bins on the floor of the hall closet. Collages! We\u2019d make collages.\n\n\u201cYay!\u201d said David Michael when I told him my idea.\n\n\u201cYay!\u201d echoed Emily Michelle. I knew that she\u2019d make more of a mess than a work of art, but I knew she\u2019d have fun, too. She loves fooling around with scraps of paper and glue and Magic Markers.\n\nI grabbed a stack of newspapers and magazines and brought them to the kitchen table. Then I got out safety scissors, glue, crayons and markers, and some paper. I sat David Michael and Emily Michelle at the table and told them to go to it.\n\nPretty soon David Michael was cutting away, his tongue sticking out as he concentrated on not slicing off Darryl Strawberry\u2019s head. It only took Emily Michelle about thirty seconds to get glue all over her hands \u2014 but I let her go wild, since she was wearing old clothes.\n\nI picked up a recent issue of Stoneybrook News, thinking that I might find some interesting things for the two of them to cut out. Most of what I glanced at looked fairly boring, though. There was a long story about the new sewage treatment plant, and another about some people\u2019s fiftieth wedding anniversary.\n\nI kept leafing through the paper, looking for good pictures. Then this ad caught my eye. \u201cCalling All Babies!\u201d it said. It was an ad for the Stoneybrook Baby Parade.\n\nThe",

My dad and my stepmother were at work, and my stepsister was baby\u2011sitting. My stepsister is Dawn Schafer, and she happens to be one of my two best friends. She\u2019s also an eighth\u2011grader at SMS.\n\nI was waiting around to baby\u2011sit, too. Later that afternoon I would be picked up and driven to the Kormans\u2019 house, where I would sit with their three children \u2014 Bill, Melody, and Skylar \u2014 until about nine\u2011thirty. My friends and I baby\u2011sit a lot. In fact, we baby\u2011sit so much that we\u2019ve formed a business called the Baby\u2011sitters Club (or the BSC). A bunch of my friends and I are the regular club members. Six of us live in my neighborhood, but our club president, Kristy Thomas, lives in a fancy area across town, where she moved when her mom got remarried. The Kormans live across the street and one house up from Kristy. I haven\u2019t baby\u2011sat for them too often. Partly, this is because they are new here. (They moved into the house where a family named Delaney used to live.) Anyway, since Kristy lives so close by, she baby\u2011sits for the Kormans more than the rest of us do.",

          "text": "I don\u2019t know why this is true, but it is, at least for me. See, for the longest time I lived with just my dad. My mother died when I was really little, and I don\u2019t remember her. After that it was Dad and me on our own. And I spent a lot of time alone. That was mostly because I didn\u2019t have any brothers or sisters, but also because my father was really strict with me. I think he wanted to prove to everyone that he could raise a daughter just fine, and be both a father and a mother to me. But he made up all these rules! He told me what to wear, how to fix my hair, and how to decorate my room. He wouldn\u2019t let me ride my bicycle downtown or talk on the phone after dinner unless I was talking about homework. And I had to go to bed unreasonably early. It was no wonder I hardly had any friends, except for Kristy Thomas. (We used to live next door to each other. That was before we both moved. Kristy is my other best friend.)\n\nBut things began to change, first slowly, then quite suddenly. The slow changes started when I was finally able to convince my father that I was a middle\u2011schooler, not a baby, and that I was responsible, honest, and all those other good things. When Dad realized that, he loosened the reins. He let me wear my hair however I wanted instead of in two braids. He let me choose my own clothes. (Within reason. I\u2019m not allowed to wear really cool things, such as cowboy boots, the way most of my friends are. And I\u2019m still not allowed to get my ears pierced, although Dad lets me wear clip\u2011ons.) Dad also lightened up on the telephone and bedtime rules.",

The Schafers had been living in California, but when they got divorced, Mrs. Schafer, Dawn, and Dawn\u2019s younger brother, Jeff, moved back here to Stoneybrook. And then Dad and Sharon (that\u2019s Mrs. Shafer) got together (okay, Dawn and I got them together), they dated for what seemed like ages, and finally they got married! That was the sudden change. After the wedding, Dad and I and my kitten, Tigger, moved into Dawn\u2019s house, because it\u2019s bigger. (In case you\u2019re interested, it\u2019s a colonial farmhouse with a real secret passage that might be haunted.) So that\u2019s where I live with my new family. Oh, except for Jeff.

          "text": "Sometime during all these changes, I met Logan, and we became friends and started going out together. This was odd for a couple of reasons. One, if Dad had been as strict as he used to be, I would never have been allowed to date Logan or anyone else. Two, I am the shyest of all my friends \u2014 and I was the first to start dating a boy steadily.\n\nAs I said before, Logan and I grew so close I felt as if we were almost a part of each other. We shared secrets, and we understood each other perfectly. At least, I thought we did. But I began to feel sort of smothered by Logan. Since he knew that I was shy and didn\u2019t necessarily speak up (even though I was honest with him), he began to take charge of things. He would expect me always to be free to go out with him, he\u2019d choose the movie we were going to see, and sometimes he\u2019d even order for me in restaurants \u2014 without asking what I wanted to eat. He wasn\u2019t letting me be me. So after a lot of thinking (and believe me, this took every ounce of courage I had), I finally told Logan I wanted to cool our relationship. I needed time to consider things. Only I guess I took too long, or maybe Logan took things the wrong way. At any rate, our relationship cooled off so much that it froze and snapped in two.\n\nAnd so I missed Logan.\n\nAnd I felt lonelier than I ever had when I was an \u201calone\u201d person and didn\u2019t know what I was missing.",

          "text": "Today \u2014 at exactly 2:15 PM \u2014 my entire life changed. That was when Mr. Dougherty, my creative writing teacher, told my class about Young Authors Day.\n\nI\u2019m Mallory Pike. Most people call me Mal. I\u2019m eleven years old, and I want to be a writer. Correction. I am going to be a writer. And I am going to write about everything. And illustrate my books, too.\n\nAnyway, Mr. Dougherty announced the event to my creative writing class, which is a special one that I was invited to join because of my writing talent. (Does that sound too conceited? I hope not.) I was so thrilled when I was picked for his class because not only is Mr. Dougherty the coolest, funniest, smartest teacher I have ever had, but he has actually had a book published. He\u2019s a real author like I want to be. The kids in my class call him Mr. D. He seems to like it, too. He\u2019s kind of round and jolly, with a big, bushy mustache that he twirls around his finger whenever he\u2019s pleased with something. He always twirls it when we call him Mr. D.\n\nNow, where was I? Oh, right. Young Authors Day. Mr. D told us that it is a special day celebrating future writers. A famous author is going to talk to the whole school about writing and how to get a book published, and then a contest is going to be held, with prizes going to the best writers in Stoneybrook Middle School. There are lots of categories that we can enter: Best Poem, Best Short Story, Best Mystery, Best Illustration of a Story, and (the one I hope to win) Best Overall Fiction for the Sixth Grade. When I told Mr. D that was the category I wanted to enter, his eyes twinkled and he twirled the ends of his mustache. (So I know he was pleased.)\n\nI couldn\u2019t wait to tell Jessi about it. She\u2019s my best friend. Jessica Ramsey is her full name, but no one ever calls her that, except maybe her parents when they\u2019re mad at her. Jessi is beautiful. She\u2019s tall and thin, with wonderful long legs that are just right for a ballerina, which is what she is. And not just any ballerina, either, but one of the best at this really good ballet school she goes to in Stamford. Just to show you how great a dancer she is, Jessi\u2019s had the lead in several major productions recently, including Copp\u00e9lia, in which she played Swanilda. I go to every one of her performances, and so do the rest of my friends in the Baby-sitters Club \u2014 but I\u2019ll tell you about them later.\n\nJessi is the same age as me, eleven. We\u2019re both junior officers in the BSC (Baby\u2011sitters Club). We\u2019re a lot alike except for a few things. First, I come from a huge family with eight kids. And guess what. Three of them are identical triplets. But even though they look alike, Byron, Jordan, and Adam have very different personalities \u2014 especially Byron, who\u2019s quieter and more sensitive than his brothers.\n\nPeople often say we\u2019re stair\u2011step kids, which means that we were born one after the other. And they\u2019re right. You see, I\u2019m the oldest. The triplets, who are ten, are right behind me. My sister Vanessa is nine, Nicky is eight, Margo is seven, and last but not least is Claire. She\u2019s five. Can you imagine eating dinner with that many people every night? It can be a zoo, sometimes. But Mom and Dad don\u2019t seem to be bothered by it. They\u2019re great.\n\nEveryone in my family has chestnut brown hair and blue eyes. And out of all ten of us, Nicky and I are the ones who wear glasses. Which I hate. I\u2019ve begged my parents for contacts, but they say I have to wait until I\u2019m older. I also wear braces. (The clear plastic kind.) And as long as we\u2019re on the subject of things I hate, let\u2019s talk about my nose. I got it from my grandfather. If I could get rid of it, I would.\n\nJessi doesn\u2019t wear braces or glasses, and her family is regular-sized (two parents and three kids, plus her Aunt Cecelia). Jessi\u2019s eight\u2011year\u2011old sister is named Becca (short for Rebecca), and her baby brother is nicknamed Squirt. His real name is John Philip Ramsey, Jr., which is a very big name for such a little guy.\n\nAnother difference between Jessi and me is that she\u2019s black and I\u2019m white. In fact, Jessi is the only black student in the entire sixth grade. It doesn\u2019t mean anything to me, but it did to a lot of people when the Ramseys first moved to Stoneybrook, Connecticut. (That\u2019s where we live.) I\u2019m ashamed to say that some of the people in Stoneybrook were pretty rotten to them at first. But things have gotten much better for the Ramseys.",

When I told her that I had a chance at winning the Best Overall Fiction award for the entire sixth grade, Jessi gave me a hug. The two of us stood on the street corner, where we usually go our separate ways, squealing with excitement.

And Jessi, my best friend, was happy for me.\n\n\u201cJust think!\u201d I said, pushing my glasses up on my nose. \u201cI have the whole weekend to work on my prize\u2011winning short story.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have any idea what you\u2019re going to write about?\u201d Jessi asked.\n\nI shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m planning to hole up in my room and use the next two days to come up with the perfect award\u2011winning idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could write a horse story,\u201d Jessi suggested. \u201cEveryone loves them, especially the ones by \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMarguerite Henry!\u201d we both said at the same time. She\u2019s our favorite author.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to check my journal,\u201d I said after we stopped giggling. (I\u2019m not sure why we were giggling so much. Maybe just because it was Friday and we were happy.) \u201cI\u2019ve written a lot of ideas in there. I think I\u2019ll take a look at it and then decide.\u201d\n\nI keep my journal under my mattress in my bedroom, which I share with Vanessa. Not that I need to hide it from her. She\u2019s a poet and understands a writer\u2019s need for privacy.\n\n\u201cFirst I am going to finish all my homework this afternoon, so I can focus my complete attention on \".",

He doesn\u2019t say many words yet, but he loves to swing, so he made up a word for that pretty quickly.\n\nI am Jessica Ramsey, known as Jessi. I\u2019m eleven years old. My family and I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, a small town. We\u2019re sort of newcomers, since we arrived near the beginning of this school year, when I was starting sixth grade. I have a mom and a dad; a sister, Rebecca; and of course Squirt. Both of my parents work. They like their jobs a lot. In fact, Dad likes his so much that when his company told him he was being transferred to the branch office in Stamford, Connecticut, he picked up and moved us Ramseys to Stoneybrook, which is near Stamford. (We used to live in New\u202fJersey.)\n\nRebecca is eight. Just as I go by the nickname Jessi, she goes by the nickname Becca. Becca is a neat little sister. She has a sense of humor and a good imagination, although she\u2019s shy. Sometimes I think she\u2019s too sensitive. Maybe she needs to develop a thicker skin. On the other hand, if she weren\u2019t so sensitive, she might not be so kind and thoughtful. Here\u2019s an example of what makes Becca special. You know how most kids participate in some kind of after\u2011school activity? Like sports or dance lessons or Brownies or Cub Scouts? Well, when Becca decided to try an activity for the first time, she joined the Kids\u2011Can\u2011Do\u2011Anything Club at her school, Stoneybrook Elementary. The club (which the members refer to simply as the Kids Club) is for boys and girls ages eight, nine, and ten, and its purpose is to \u2026 help others. The kids think of ways to help out in the community. Then the two teachers, who volunteer their time to run the club, help the kids carry out their plans. The kids have done all sorts of things. They cleaned up the trash in an empty lot so the mayor could put a park there. They collected food for people who wouldn\u2019t have had a Thanksgiving otherwise. And now they were working on a toy drive. They were collecting new toys to give to the children\u2019s ward at the hospital. Becca always comes home from a Kids Club meeting with a huge smile on her face.\n\nThere are two other members of our household. One is Misty, our hamster. The other is Aunt Cecelia. She moved in to watch Squirt and to give us a hand when Mama went back to work. Becca and I used to call her Aunt Dictator. That was right after she moved in, when she didn\u2019t really understand my family. She was so strict and mean. But now she is much nicer, and we all get along pretty well. The one thing I don\u2019t like about Aunt Cecelia is that she still seems to think she\u2019s my baby\u2011sitter. And I\u2019m already a baby\u2011sitter! Before Aunt Cecelia came, I was always taking care of Becca and Squirt. Now I don\u2019t have the chance very often. Which is a shame because I love to baby\u2011sit and (sorry for bragging) I\u2019m really good at it. I\u2019m good enough to be part of a business called the Baby\u2011sitters Club.",

          "text": "Today, though, I was sitting. It was a weekday afternoon. Mama and Daddy were at work. And Aunt Cecelia had made plans with some friends. So I was in charge of Squirt. And as soon as Becca returned from her Kids Club meeting I would be in charge of her, too.\n\nSquirt had stopped singing \u201cWhing, whing.\u201d In fact, he held his arms toward me. That meant he wanted to get out of the swing. I lifted him up and set him on the ground near our swing set.\n\n\u201cCome on, Squirt. Walk to me!\u201d My brother is beginning to toddle around. It\u2019s a good thing he wears about nineteen diapers. They provide a nice cushion for when he suddenly sits on his bottom, which happens about every ten wobbly steps he takes.\n\n\u201cDa!\u201d cried Squirt, and hurtled himself into my arms.\n\nI heard a clank in our garage then and realized that Becca had come home from school. (The clank was the sound of the kickstand on her bicycle hitting the cement floor.) A few moments later, she rounded the corner into our backyard.\n\n\u201cHi, Becca!\u201d I called.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d Becca\u2019s eyes were downcast. She didn\u2019t smile. She didn\u2019t even greet Squirt, whom she loves as much as I do. (In case you\u2019re wondering, Squirt is not my brother\u2019s real name. His name is John Philip Ramsey, Jr. But when he was born in the Oakley, New\u202fJersey, hospital, he was the smallest baby in the nursery. It was the hospital staff who first called him Squirt, and the name has stuck, even though Squirt isn\u2019t much of a squirt anymore.)\n\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d I asked Becca. \u201cSomething with the toy drive?\u201d\n\nBecca dropped her schoolbag on the ground and sat on the end of the slide. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied, \u201cthe toy drive is going really well. Bellair\u2019s gave us one hundred dollars\u2019 worth of new toys.\u201d (Bellair\u2019s is Stoneybrook\u2019s department store.)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cSo why do you look like you just lost your best fr \u2014?\u201d I stopped talking. Maybe Becca had just lost her best friend. Maybe she\u2019d had a fight with Charlotte Johanssen. Having a fight with a friend is never fun, but for Becca it would be a crushing blow. First of all, she doesn\u2019t make friends easily. Second of all, moving to Stoneybrook was difficult for my family; not just because of who we left behind in New\u202fJersey (our relatives and good friends), but because not everyone in Stoneybrook accepted us in the beginning. That was because my family is black, and only a few black families live in Stoneybrook. People thought we were \u201cdifferent.\u201d But now we\u2019ve settled in and made friends. However \u2014 had something happened between Becca and Charlotte?\n\n\u201cDid you and Char have a fight?\u201d I asked.\n\nBecca looked shocked. \u201cA fight?\u201d she squeaked.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re upset about something.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but \u2026.\u201d\n\nBecause Ms. Simon\u2019s husband is going on a really long trip, and she decided to go with him.

In it, some girl spills a huge glass of chocolate milk on a living room carpet (white, of course). Her mom gets hysterical, then sprays the stain with some carpet cleaner. Out of the can rushes a team of hungry cartoon gremlins. Ta\u2011da! The gremlins eat the stain and the mom hugs the girl, who smiles cutely with one front tooth missing. Happy music plays in the background.\n\nSo realistic. I mean, does anyone ask how the gremlins got in the spray can? Wouldn\u2019t the mom and daughter run away screaming if they really saw those disgusting things? And what happens to the gremlins after they finish? Do they hang out in the house forever?

I\u2019m thirteen, and in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School, in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I have a hard enough time with normal classes. The first time I heard Janine mention \u201ccalculus\u201d I thought she was talking about a Roman emperor. Then she showed me her book. You know what the strangest thing was? Calculus is supposed to be a kind of math \u2014 but there were hardly any numbers! It was mostly a bunch of squiggles and letters. Janine tried to explain it to me, but I suddenly felt like I\u2019d taken a sleeping pill. Boring!\n\nAs you can gather, my sister and I could hardly be more different. We do both have dark hair and almond\u2011shaped eyes (our family is Japanese\u2011American), but that\u2019s about it. I\u2019m into wild clothes and different hairstyles. That afternoon, for instance, I was wearing a man\u2019s paisley vest I\u2019d found at a yard sale, over a striped button\u2011down shirt with tuxedo\u2011stripe black Spandex stirrup pants, held up with pink\u2011flecked black suspenders. My hair was pulled straight back with a paisley comb, and I was wearing electric\u2011pink ankle boots. The boots really set off the formality of the rest of the outfit, sort of like the punchline of a joke. I think you can tell a lot about people from the way they dress. If you saw me, you might think: artistic, fun\u2011loving, good sense of humor. At least I hope you\u2019d think that.\n\nIf you saw Janine, you\u2019d think: smart, very smart, unbelievably smart. Her hair is always in a page boy, and she\u2019d be perfectly happy wearing a white Oxford blouse and a gray pleated skirt every day. Janine\u2019s main accessory is a book cradled in her right arm. Exactly the way you\u2019d expect someone with a 196 I.Q. to dress.\n\nThat\u2019s right, 196. \u201cNormal\u201d is 100, \u201cbright\u201d is 120, and \u201cgenius\u201d is 150.

Actually it\u2019s a photo of Mimi when she was my age, and it\u2019s amazing how much she looks like me.\n\nSomehow I can\u2019t imagine that Mimi ever had a room like mine, though. It\u2019s \u2026 well, multipurpose. For one thing, it\u2019s the place where I sleep. (No kidding.) For another, it\u2019s my studio.

Awhile ago I moved here to Stoneybrook, Connecticut, with my mother and my younger brother, Jeff.\n\nMom came back to Stoneybrook after she and my dad got divorced. Stoneybrook is where she grew up. Pop-pop and Granny (Mom\u2019s parents) still live here. I guess that made Mom feel a little more secure, since the divorce was hard on her at first.\n\nUnfortunately, Mom was the only one who was happy about the move. Jeff and I missed California like crazy. I missed my friends and the warm weather, and everything Californian.\n\nThere was only one thing I liked about Stoneybrook right from the start. Our house. It was built in 1795. Can you imagine? The doorways are low, the stairways are narrow, and the rooms are small and dark. It is the total opposite of the sunny ranch\u2011style house we left back in California. But for some reason I loved our new (old) house right away.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the best part. Our house has a secret passage that leads from the barn in the backyard right into my bedroom! It was probably once part of the Underground Railroad, which helped slaves from the South escape to freedom in the North. How\u2019s that for total coolness!",

It didn\u2019t take long for us to become best friends.\n\nAt first glance, Mary Anne sure didn\u2019t look like somebody who would become my best friend. Her brown hair was in pigtails, and she always wore these awful little\u2011kid jumpers. Since she\u2019s on the short side, she appeared much younger than a seventh\u2011grader. Which is what she was. (So was I. Now we\u2019re both in eighth grade.)\n\nMary Anne and I must have made a pretty odd couple. There she was, short and kind of kidlike. And there I was, tall, with long (waist\u2011length) white\u2011blonde hair, and my own style of dressing. (My friends call it California casual.)\n\nStill, despite looks, there was a lot to like about Mary Anne. She\u2019s extremely sensitive and a great listener. Talking to her felt very natural and easy. And as we got to know each other better, two things happened that I would never have expected.",

It\u2019s the reason I eventually came to like Stoneybrook. I\u2019ll tell you more about it later.\n\nThe second unexpected thing was that Mary Anne and I discovered our parents had dated when they were in high school. More than dated \u2014 they were in love! We could tell by the romantic stuff they wrote to each other in their yearbooks. (We found my mother\u2019s yearbook first.

They did everything to break them up, including sending Mom to college in California. Their plan worked \u2014 almost. Mom met my dad in California. And Richard also married someone else, who became Mary Anne\u2019s mom.\n\nBut now, as you know, Mom was single again. And Mary Anne\u2019s mother died when Mary Anne was little, so Richard was also single. With a small push from Mary Anne and me, they started dating again. (And dating, and dating, and dating.

And even though I sometimes go to California to visit, I still miss Jeff.\n\nOn that particular day, though, Jeff was here visiting for winter vacation. He\u2019d been a total pest since the second he got off the plane. The only reason we had quiet at that moment was because he\u2019d gone off to visit his friends the Pike triplets. (Truthfully, I didn\u2019t mind his pestiness. It felt as if he\u2019d never left.)\n\nBesides Jeff\u2019s going to California, we had a few other problems with the divorce and the remarriage. Mom had to get used to Tigger, Mary Anne\u2019s kitten. Mary Anne and I had to get used to sharing a room (which didn\u2019t work out, and now we have our own rooms).

          "text": "Snow was falling again.\n\nFor a planet that\u2019s supposed to be feeling the effects of global warming, it certainly was having a cold winter. And a snowy one. That was okay with me. I like snow. It makes me feel cozy. Now that my mom and I live in a real house in the country and have an actual working fireplace, the coziness is even better. Last week when it was snowing (for, like, the seventy\u2011fifth time since the beginning of January), Mom and I made popcorn after supper and ate it in front of the fire. No TV, no radio or music, just Mom and me and the popcorn and the fireplace.\n\nDoes that sound lonely? Well, it wasn\u2019t. It was peaceful and wonderful. But I have to tell you that my family used to be bigger. That was when my parents were living together. But a few months ago they got divorced. Mom and I moved here to Stoneybrook, Connecticut. Oh, all right, we don\u2019t actually live in the country. We live in a small town. But Stoneybrook sure feels like the country compared to New York City, which is where I grew up. And where my father still lives.\n\nMy name is Stacey McGill. I\u2019m thirteen. I\u2019m an only child. And I am now officially a divorced kid. As I said, I grew up in New York, the Big Apple. I was born there, and I love that city. Really. I love everything about it. Well, almost everything. I don\u2019t love rats, of course. Or cockroaches. Or crime or guns or violence. But I do love the museums and the historical landmarks and the stores and theaters and restaurants. And the tall buildings. And the hidden pockets of surprise \u2014 tiny parks and old houses and gardens that you find just by turning a corner, and that are not mentioned in any guidebook. (Can you tell I good old NYC?)\n\nOkay, so I was born in the city, and Mom and Dad and I lived there until the company Dad works for changed his job and we had to relocate to Connecticut. That was at the beginning of seventh grade. I am now an eighth\u2011grader at Stoneybrook Middle School (SMS). But I haven\u2019t lived solely in Connecticut during the past year. No, that would be too simple. Here\u2019s the thing: We\u2019d been living in Stoneybrook for just under a year (long enough for me to adjust to small\u2011town life and to make a group of really good friends, including a new best friend), when Dad\u2019s company transferred him back to New York. So we picked up and moved again. I returned to my old life. A new apartment, but the same private school, the same NYC neighborhood, and my other best friend, my New York best friend, Laine Cummings.\n\nAnd then it happened. Something I\u2019d been afraid of for a few years, ever since the parents of several of my friends started getting divorced. My own parents began to fight. And finally they made The Announcement. They were getting divorced. To make things even more complicated, Dad decided to stay in New York (he would move to a small apartment, though), while Mom wanted to return to Stoneybrook. I had to choose where I wanted to live. In other words, I had to choose between my parents. After a lot of thinking (and a lot of crying and apologizing), I decided to go back to Connecticut. But I made my parents promise I could visit Dad in New York a lot. They promised. So here I am in Stoneybrook, in a little house with Mom.\n\nWhy did I decide to live in Connecticut instead of in the Big Apple? Mostly because I have so many friends here. The first time I moved to Stoneybrook I joined the Baby\u2011sitters Club (BSC). (I\u2019ll explain that later.) The club is made up of seven members: me and six other SMS students. Those six students are my good friends. And one of them, Claudia Kishi, is the new best friend I mentioned.\n\nI do miss Dad and New York and Laine Cummings, but they\u2019re just a train ride away, which isn\u2019t bad.",

          "text": "* * *\n\nThat snowy afternoon was on a Wednesday. My friends and I were going to hold a BSC meeting, but it wouldn\u2019t start for two hours, so I decided to begin my homework. Often on weekday afternoons I\u2019m busy with a baby\u2011sitting job. But not that day.\n\nI pulled out my math book. I just adore math. (Honest. I really do.) Before I had even opened the book, though, the phone rang. I dashed into Mom\u2019s room and picked up the upstairs extension.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHey, Anastasia! It\u2019s me!\u201d\n\n\u201cLaine!\u201d I cried. \u201cHi \u2026 Why are you calling me Anastasia?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess it\u2019s just more grown\u2011up than Stacey.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess,\u201d I replied. I pictured Laine. She was probably curled up in the armchair next to her phone. (Note that I said her phone. She has a private line and everything. Well, so does Claud, my other best friend.)\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d asked Laine.\n\n\u201cFine. How are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m great! All I can think about is our winter break. It\u2019s coming up, you know. One week surrounded by two weekends. Nine glorious days of freedom, from Saturday, February seventh, through Sunday, February fifteenth. I absolutely cannot wait.\u201d\n\nI smiled. Vacations have always been important to Laine. And since my parents are good friends of her parents, we\u2019ve taken some vacations together. I mean, our families have.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do during those nine glorious days?\u201d I asked.\n\nLaine sighed. \u201cI have so many choices,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPoor baby.\u201d\n\nLaine laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s see. What I think I\u2019m going to do is just stay here. There\u2019ll be a ton of good parties to go to. And King will be here. We\u2019ll go to the parties together. King is really tight with my friends. The age difference doesn\u2019t seem to matter at all. You know.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know. Laine and I are close, but it\u2019s not like we talk every day, the way we did when we were going to the same school. \u201cUm \u2026 what do you mean? About the age difference?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell, King is fifteen. Didn\u2019t I mention that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d The last time we had spoken was on New Year\u2019s Eve. I was sure I would have remembered if Laine had told me about a fifteen\u2011year\u2011old boyfriend named King. You don\u2019t forget a name \u2014 or an age \u2014 like that. \u201cI don\u2019t think you mentioned King at all,\u201d I told Laine.\n\n\u201cOh. Well, he goes to Rudy Matthews Schoo",

          "text": "I was thirteen years old before I became a sister, and guess what. My new sister was my age, thirteen. Were we long\u2011lost twins, separated at birth and reunited thirteen years later? No. Although that\u2019s much more interesting than the truth. The truth is that my sister is actually my stepsister. Earlier this year, my father got married again, and he happened to marry the mother of Dawn Schafer, who was already one of my best friends. So Dawn and I changed from best friends to best friends and sisters. Not many kids are that lucky.\n\nMy name is Mary Anne Spier. I\u2019m an eighth\u2011grader at Stoneybrook Middle School (commonly known as SMS) in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I was born here and have lived here all my life. Before Dawn came along, I had a very small family. Two people. My dad and me. Of course, I had a mom in the beginning, but she died when I was really small. I don\u2019t even remember her. After she died, Dad raised me. He did a good job, even if he was strict, but I always wished for a bigger family; at the very least for a baby brother or sister.\n\nWhen I was twelve and in seventh grade, a new family moved to Stoneybrook \u2014 Dawn and Jeff Schafer and their mother. The Schafers had just been divorced, and Mrs. Schafer wanted to raise her kids in the town in which she\u2019d grown up. That town was Stoneybrook. Unfortunately for Dawn and Jeff, they had grown up in California, so the move to cold, snowy Connecticut was something of a shock to them. Dawn was determined to make the best of things, though, and she adjusted to her new life fairly quickly. For one thing, she made new friends right away. I was her first friend, and I introduced her to my friends in the Baby\u2011sitters Club, which is a business we run. (I\u2019ll explain that later.) Right away, Dawn and I started spending a lot of time at one another\u2019s houses, and guess what we discovered one day when we were looking through our parents\u2019 high school yearbooks. We found out that a long time ago my dad had dated her mom. They\u2019d been sweethearts. But then they graduated from high school, and Dawn\u2019s mother went off to college in California and met Mr. Schafer and married him and eventually had Dawn and Jeff. Meanwhile, my dad had also gotten married, although he\u2019d remained in Stoneybrook.\n\nWell, Dawn and I knew just what to do with our secret. We arranged for our parents to meet again, and after awhile they began dating, then finally they got married. (In case you\u2019re wondering, Jeff moved back to California to live with his father. That happened before his mom married my dad. He was simply never happy in Connecticut. He missed his old life too much. I love Jeff, but I hardly ever see him.)",

          "text": "\"Dawn? How come the hedge clippers are in the bread drawer?\" I asked one day. It was a Monday afternoon. School was over, and Dawn and I were prowling around the kitchen, fixing a snack.\n\nDawn shrugged. \"Mom\u2019s responsible, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019ll put them back.\"\n\nDawn took the clippers from me and headed for the door to the garage. She was smiling.\n\nDawn\u2019s mother, whom she calls Mom and I call Sharon, is just a teensy bit, oh, scatter\u2011brained. Sharon is really nice, and I\u2019m lucky she\u2019s my stepmother, but I\u2019m just not used to finding hedge clippers in the bread drawer, or my sweater in the freezer, or the TV remote control on a shelf in the bathroom. I grew up with a father who could have run for the presidency of the Neat People\u2019s Society. Dawn grew up with a mother who wouldn\u2019t have been allowed within miles of a meeting of the NPS. Actually, she isn\u2019t so much messy as she is completely disorganized \u2014 as opposed to my father, who color\u2011codes his socks. How they became friends is beyond me. How they became husband and wife is, I think, beyond even them, but they do love each other. And the four of us are learning how to live together without going batty. A few months ago, I might have freaked out if I found a pair of hedge clippers in the bread drawer. Now I can handle the situation calmly.\n\nDawn returned from the garage, and we sat at the kitchen table with snacks in front of us. Mine was a nice, normal after\u2011school snack \u2014 an apple and a handful of chocolate chip cookies. Dawn\u2019s was a salad bar \u2014 a carrot stick, a zucchini stick, a celery stick, a radish, a little square of tofu, and a small container of uncooked peas. This is an example of a difference between Dawn and me, and between her mom and my dad. Dad and I eat the kind of food we were brought up on, a little of everything \u2014 fruits, vegetables, dairy stuff, meat, sweets. Dawn and her mom think it\u2019s practically a felony to eat meat. Or sugar. A really great dessert for Dawn is, like, some berries. Now, I am not, I repeat not, addicted to junk food the way our friend Claudia Kishi is, but excuse me, berries are not dessert as far as I\u2019m concerned. Cake is dessert. Chocolate pie is dessert. A large brownie is dessert. Maybe berries are dessert, but only if a piece of cheesecake is underneath them.\n\nDawn poked around at her peas, and I bit into my apple.\n\n\"I saw the twins\u2019 baby brother this morning,\" said Dawn. (We have friends \u2014 not close friends, just school friends \u2014 who are twins. Their names are Mariah and Miranda Shillaber, and they have a brother who is just a year and a half old.)\n\n\"You did?\" I said. \"Where? Is he adorable?\"\n\n\"Yeah, he\u2019s pretty cute. He was with Mrs. Shillaber. They\u2019d dropped off Mariah and Miranda at school.\"\n\n\"The twins are so lucky,\" I said. \"I wish our parents would have a baby. They still could, you know. It isn\u2019t too late.\"\n\n\"And if my mom doesn\u2019t want to give birth to another baby,\" added Dawn, \"then she and Richard could adopt one.\" (Richard is my father.)\n\n\"I know. It worked for Kristy\u2019s family.\"\n\nThe parents of one of our close friends, Kristy Thomas (who\u2019s also a member of the Baby\u2011sitters Club), adopted a two\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half\u2011year\u2011old Vietnamese girl. And they already had six kids between them.\n\n\"My mother wouldn\u2019t even have to quit work,\" said Dawn. \"Kristy\u2019s mother still works. Of cou",

I share it with Vanessa, another sister of mine. We have to share rooms because there are so many of us Pikes. We have (are you ready for this?) eight kids in our family.

Then come the triplets, Byron, Adam, and Jordan, who are ten, and Vanessa, who\u2019s nine. Nicky\u2019s eight, Margo is seven, and Claire is five.\n\nAll of us Pike kids have brown hair and blue eyes, but I\u2019m the only one who has curly reddish hair. I am also the only one with braces (lucky me). Plus, I have to wear glasses.\n\nBeing the oldest is not as great as it might sound. Lots of times my parents expect me to help out with baby-sitting, which I don\u2019t mind doing, but not all the time. For awhile I felt like they were really taking me for granted, but we worked it out, and now they always schedule my sitting jobs just like we do in the BSC.\n\nWhat\u2019s the BSC? It stands for the Baby-sitters Club, which is the greatest group of friends anyone could have. But I\u2019ll tell you about that later.",

          "text": "Anyway, it was a Saturday and Jessi Ramsey, my best friend in Stoneybrook, Connecticut (and the world), was at my house for the day. We were doing what we usually do on rainy Saturday afternoons \u2014 talking about horses.\n\nJessi and I love horses. In fact you could say we are horse\u2011crazy. We love to read books about horses. Our favorites are those by Marguerite Henry, who wrote Misty of Chincoteague. But we\u2019ll read any book about a horse. Someday I hope to be a great author and write and illustrate books about horses of all kinds \u2014 mustangs, quarter\u2011horses, Appaloosas, Clydesdales, Percherons \u2014 you name it. I love them all.\n\nWhile I would like to be an author, Jessi wants to be a ballerina. And she will be. I\u2019m sure of it. First of all, she\u2019s got the perfect dancer\u2019s body \u2014 slim, long legs, a beautiful neck, and graceful fingers. Second of all, she has already danced several leading roles in ballets in nearby Stamford. We (the rest of the BSC and I) always go to her performances, and boy is she good.\n\nJessica (that\u2019s her formal name) has a younger sister, Becca, short for Rebecca, and a baby brother, John Philip Ramsey, Jr., which is a very big name for such a little guy. Everyone calls him Squirt. Jessi\u2019s Aunt Cecelia lives with her family, too. So altogether the Ramseys have six people living in their house. We have ten. That\u2019s one of the main differences between me and Jessi. Also, Jessi is black and I\u2019m white. It doesn\u2019t matter to me, but it did to some people in town when the Ramseys first moved to Stoneybrook. They really had a tough time in the beginning, but that\u2019s all in the past. Now things are much better for Jessi and her family.\n\nAnyway, Jessi was lying on my bed with one of her legs extended in the air. It nearly touched her ear. (Ow!) Jessi always does stretching exercises when she\u2019s sitting around so that she\u2019ll stay limber for ballet. I\u2019ve gotten so used to it that I hardly notice it anymore. She was reading Misty of Chincoteague again and I was sitting cross\u2011legged on the floor, reading the ending of Black Beauty for the two hundredth time, when Claire burst into the room, straddling her mop.\n\n\"Whoa! Whoa!\" I said, after she\u2019d circled the room several times. When Claire pulled her mop (I mean, horse) to a stop, I asked, \"What are you doing riding Noodle in the house?\"\n\n\"I\u2019m practicing for the circus. I\u2019m the bareback rider.\" Claire pointed proudly at the mop handle. \"See? No saddle.\"\n\n\"I think your horse could use some more oats,\" Jessi said, trying to keep a straight face. \"He\u2019s kind of skinny.\"\n\nClaire put her hands on her hips, and her mop\u2011horse clattered to the ground. \"He is not. He\u2019s perfect.\"\n\n\"Claire,\" I said, pointing to the mop lying on the rug, \"you dropped your horse.\"\n\nClaire looked at the mop and declared, \"Noodle is resting. He\u2019s very sleepy.\" She stifled a yawn as she spoke.\n\nMy parents were home, so I wasn\u2019t officially on baby\u2011sitting duty, but I knew when Claire needed a nap. I picked up Noodle in one hand and guided Claire out of the room. \"Meet me in the rec room,\" I called to Jessi over my shoulder. \"We\u2019ll make popcorn and watch The Black Stallion again.\"\n\n\"Great!\" she replied. The Black Stallion is one of our absolute favorite movies.\n\n\"But I have to practice my riding,\" Claire protested feebly as I helped her onto her bed.\n\n\"Noodle\u2019s too tired,\" I explained, laying the mop on the floor beside my sister\u2019s bed. \"He just needs a quick nap and then he\u2019ll be ready to do higher leaps and gallop even faster around the ring.\"\n\n\"You really think so?\" she murmured, snuggling her head into her pillow.\n\n\"I know so.\" I draped a light quilt over Claire and then tiptoed out the door and down the stairs. It was very quiet upstairs, but downstairs was a different story.",

(Double ow!) \"If you could pick your dream horse, what would it be?\"\n\n\"Oh, boy.\" I sank back in the overstuffed chair by the television and thought for a second. \"He\u2019d have to be an Arabian. They\u2019re the nicest.

          "text": "\"All right, ladies, tour jet\u00e9 across ze room!\u201d Mme Noelle called out.\n\nOur ballet class was almost over. We were all sweating horribly. (Oops! I mean, we were glowing. As Madame says, \u201cHorses sweat, gentlemen perspire, and ladies glow!\u201d) Was Madame going to let us do some gentle pli\u00e9s to cool down a little? Nooo. We were going to turn-and-leap, turn-and-leap around the room. That\u2019s what tour jet\u00e9s are. If you can do them really well, like Misha Baryshnikov (one of my heroes), you look like you\u2019re flying.\n\nIf you\u2019re an eleven-year-old girl in Mme Noelle\u2019s Tuesday afternoon ballet class in Stamford, Connecticut, you look \u2026 well, you look like you\u2019ve had a long day.\n\nWe lined up on the left side of the studio. Mme Noelle stood by a tape recorder with her finger over the play button, and said, \u201cMademoiselle Romsey, please lead.\u201d (That\u2019s me. Actually, I\u2019m Jessica Ramsey, but it comes out Romsey in Mme Noelle\u2019s French accent.)\n\nA loud waltz blared out of the speakers. I rounded my right arm and took a few steps to the right. Then, in a split second, here\u2019s what happened: My body spun around. My right leg lifted off the ground. My arm shot forward in an arc \u2014 and I was soaring! (Maybe not like Misha, but as close as I could get.) I did it again and again, springing into the air at each downbeat of the waltz.\n\nWhen I completed a circle around the room, I could hear Madame say, \u201cGood leeft, Mademoiselle Romsey, very gracefool \u2014 but do not let zee trailing arm droop.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, only I was panting so hard it came out more like, \u201cKuhhh.\u201d\n\nI was hot and grimy and I just wanted to plop onto the floor. A big fan in the corner was blowing warm, musty air across the room \u2014 definitely not refreshing. But here\u2019s the strange thing: I felt great. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t have minded if class had lasted another hour. Why? Because I love ballet. Even after seven years of lessons, I still get excited just walking into class. You know how some people seem to be \u201cborn\u201d comedians or artists or athletes? Well, I\u2019m a born dancer. Wait a minute, that sounds conceited. What I mean is, dancing makes me happier than anything else. Also, I have these really long legs, which \u201cturn out\u201d naturally (a big advantage).\n\nI\u2019ve already learned to dance on my toes (which is called en pointe) and I\u2019ve played lead roles in a few ballets, like Swanilda in Copp\u00e9lia and Princess Aurora in Sleeping Beauty. Someday I hope to be a professional ballerina, if I can stand the years of hard work and \u201cdeeseepleen,\u201d Madame\u2019s favorite word (translation: discipline). And that means the rest of my life would be like this:\n\n1. Watching what I eat. (Have you ever seen a fat ballerina?)\n\n2. Taking as many classes a week as possible.\n\n3. Stretching all the time, to keep my muscles limber.\n\n4. Becoming familiar with the classical ballets I might be in someday.\n\nPretty tough, huh? My dad says being a ballerina is like being in the army \u2014 except in boot camp you don\u2019t wear a tutu.\n\nMy dad, by the way, has a great sense of humor. Which comes in handy whenever he has to wait for me in his car outside my dance school after a long day\u2019s work. Which is what he was doing that Tuesday of the tour jet\u00e9s.",

I quickly did some stretching exercises at the barre, then ran to the changing room.\n\nIn seconds I was dressed in white sweatpants, pink leg warmers, and a pink-and-white sweat shirt that said \u201cABT,\u201d which stands for American Ballet Theater. I stuffed my sweaty (glowy?) dance clothes in my canvas bag, slung it over my shoulder, and ran out of school.\n\nDaddy was waiting in the car, a big smile on his face. \u201cHi, baby,\u201d he said as I climbed in the passenger seat. \u201cHow was class?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d I answered. \u201cHow was work?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask!\u201d Daddy said, laughing. Lately we say the same thing after ballet class. It\u2019s like a ritual. The best part is Daddy\u2019s laugh, which is deep and booming. He sounds sort of like James Earl Jones, the famous actor.\n\nDaddy drove away from the curb and headed toward the expressway. We live in Stoneybrook, which is just a few exits away. Stoneybrook\u2019s a nice place, but I didn\u2019t think so at first. We\u2019re black, and Stoneybrook is, like, ninety percent white. We used to live in Oakley, New Jersey, in a neighborhood where blacks and whites lived together and everybody got along just fine.\n\nStoneybrook isn\u2019t like that. When we first moved here, it was a real shock. Some people were nasty to us, just because of our skin color. The things they said and did were so prejudiced and stupid. I wanted to move back to Oakley so much. But my mom and dad always believed things would work out, and they were right.\n\nFirst of all, people have gotten used to us (doesn\u2019t that sound weird?). Second of all, I became best friends with a girl named Mallory Pike. And third of all, Mallory and I became members of the Baby-sitters Club. (I\u2019ll tell you more about Mal and the BSC later.)\n\nMy dad mopped his forehead with a handkerchief as we pulled onto the expressway. He was sweating \u2014 I mean perspiring \u2014 like crazy. Even though it was still spring, it felt like midsummer. We had to drive right under a billboard advertising some soda as the \u201cofficial drink of the Summer Olympics.\u201d There was a huge picture of a swimmer splashing through the water, in the middle of a stroke. She was working hard, but boy, did she look coooool. For a minute I thought I was crazy to like ballet. Why pound your body into a wood floor when you could plunge it into water instead?\n\nDaddy was looking at the billboard, too. He sighed and said, \u201cWhat do you say we use the air conditioner?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure!\u201d I said. Supposedly air conditioning is bad for dancers, because it can tighten your muscles. But I have to admit, I love it on really hot days.\n\nDaddy was looking at the billboard, too. He sighed and said, \u201cWhat do you say we use the air conditioner?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure!\u201d I said.

But I have to admit, I love it on really hot days.\n\nSo we drove home comfortably, without any perspiration or glow.",

The Rodowsky boys have a Lego supply bigger than what you could find in most toy stores. \"I wish I could play the piano. Or some instrument,\" Jackie said. He reached for a handful of Legos \u2014 and knocked a fin off the spaceship. The fin fell to the floor and split into pieces just as Bo, the Rodowskys\u2019 dog, tore into the rec room. He skittered on the Legos and crashed into the table on which the spaceship was being built.\n\n\"Cowabunga!\" shrieked Archie, as the table collapsed and the rocket ship slid to the floor and smashed.\n\nJackie looked at me balefully. \"Was that my fault?\" he asked.\n\nI tried to smile. \"Not really,\" I told him. \"Bo helped. Maybe Bo needs some exercise. Why don\u2019t you take him outside? Archie and I will try to put the spaceship back together.\"\n\nJackie sighed. \"Okay,\" he replied. \"But don\u2019t be surprised if I ram into the toolshed or wreck up the lawn or something.\"\n\nJackie is the teeniest bit accident-prone. Sometimes this bothers him \u2014 but mostly he is pretty happy-go-lucky.\n\nPlink, plinkety, plink, plink, blam. \"Bullfrogs!\"\n\n\"You know what I wish, Claudia?\" Archie said when Jackie and Bo were safely out the door. \"I wish I could be in a play.

          "text": "My name is Claudia Kishi. Claudia Lynn Kishi, to be exact. I\u2019m thirteen years old. I live here in the small town of Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I have a mom and a dad and an older sister. I don\u2019t have any pets, but I do have lots of friends. My best friends are the members of a business called the Baby\u2011sitters Club. I happen to be the vice\u2011president of that club (which us members call the BSC).\n\nI\u2019ve been the vice\u2011president of the BSC ever since the club started, which was back at the beginning of seventh grade. Now I\u2019m in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. I\u2019ll tell you a secret about school and me. I am not a very good student. I am especially not a good speller. It isn\u2019t that I\u2019m dumb, although sometimes I feel dumb. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t think school is very interesting. Except for art class. And when I\u2019m at home I can usually find about a dozen things to do that are more exciting than homework. My parents say I have to learn discipline and responsibility. I say I am disciplined and responsible \u2026 but who needs to know about hypotenuses (hypotenusi?) or what letter \"psychiatrist\" begins with? (Anyone with half a brain would spell that word \"sikiatrist.\" It would make much more sense. Furthermore, if you really think about it, in general, you hardly need the letter \"c\" at all. You could spell most \"c\" things with an \"s\" or a \"k.\" You only need that \"c\" for spelling \"chocolate\" or \"cheesecake,\" which by the way, could be spelled \"choklit\" and \"chezkak.\" Just a thought. But is it any wonder I\u2019m a bad speller?)\n\nI\u2019ll tell you something. I bet I wouldn\u2019t feel dumb sometimes if my sister Janine wasn\u2019t so smart. Janine is a genius. She is sixteen and basically a junior at Stoneybrook High, but already she takes courses at the local college. She did that last year, too. Can you imagine? She was fifteen and going to school with students who were, like, six years older than she was. Well, some of them were. And Janine\u2019s grades were as good as theirs. Or better. I think I\u2019m just dumb by comparison. What I mean is I\u2019m not dumb. But next to Janine I look dumb.\n\nMaybe if I got glasses and dressed in frumpy, dowdy clothes like Janine \u2014 no. I could never do that. I hope this doesn\u2019t sound conceited or shallow, but clothes and fashion are very important to me. Well, they are. They\u2019re almost as important as art and children and baby\u2011sitting. I like to look good, and I\u2019m good at looking good. All my friends say so. Sometimes they even copy my style. I wear pretty trendy clothes, and I like to be imaginative and try new things. I have to admit that the money I earn baby\u2011sitting goes for art supplies (first) and then for jewelry and accessories and stuff. I have not saved much at all. (Unlike my friends Kristy and Jessi who hoard their money like squirrels hoard acorns.)",

          "text": "I\u2019m Dawn Schafer. I\u2019m thirteen years old and have been known to be pretty outspoken when it comes to environmental issues or organic food. My friends in the BSC (Baby-sitters Club) say I\u2019m a health food nut, just because I don\u2019t eat junk food and red meat. (The sight of a hot dog makes me want to gag!) But my mom and I have always eaten healthy things like raw vegetables, tofu, and brown rice. We feel better because of our diet.\n\nMary Anne, my stepsister, is the complete opposite of me. She\u2019s not a junk-food addict, but she does like cookies and candy and hamburgers and French fries and so does her dad, Richard. Which makes meals at our house pretty crazy.\n\nGuess what. I\u2019m not from around here. I was born in California. So how did I get to Stoneybrook, Connecticut? Well, you see my mom was born here but years ago she moved to California, where she met and married my dad. Unfortunately, things didn\u2019t work out between them. When they got divorced, she brought me and my brother Jeff back to Stoneybrook.\n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t like Stoneybrook very much, but things really changed after I met Mary Anne. We became instant best friends, even though we\u2019re as different as night and day. She\u2019s short, with brown eyes and brown hair. I\u2019m tall with white\u2011blonde hair that comes down to my waist, plus I\u2019ve got blue eyes.\n\nMary Anne is sort of preppie when it comes to clothes. She wears pleated wool skirts and neat white blouses, stuff like that, while I have my own style of dress that my friends in the BSC call California Casual.\n\nSpeaking of the BSC, right after I met Mary Anne, she introduced me to her friends in the Baby\u2011sitters Club. They asked me to join and now the BSC is one of the most important things in my life.\n\nNow here\u2019s the really weird part: Mary Anne and I discovered that our parents had been in love when they were in high school (we found it out by reading their yearbooks). But they ended up marrying other people. Mary Anne\u2019s mom died when she was really little and her dad, Richard, had to raise her all by himself. He was pretty strict for most of those years, but now all that has changed.\n\nAnyway, once Mary Anne and I discovered that our parents had been high school sweethearts, we decided to get them back together. And we did! Isn\u2019t that cool?\n\nThen our parents got married (after dating forever) and now Mary Anne is not only my best friend, but my stepsister, too. Unfortunately, my brother Jeff got homesick and moved back to be with my father in California. I miss him a lot, but he\u2019s much happier with his friends and the warmer weather. It can get super cold here! Especially in the drafty old farmhouse we live in. It\u2019s over two hundred years old and even has a secret passage leading from the barn to my room. I\u2019m not sure, but I think it could be haunted.\n\nThings were really crazy at our house after our parents got together. Mary Anne and I discovered that even though we liked each other a lot, we have very different habits. For instance, I have to listen to music when I study. Mary Anne needs complete silence. And like I said before, I\u2019m totally into health food. Mary Anne could take it or leave it. Plus, I\u2019m outgoing and a little impulsive. Mary Anne is on the shy side.\n\nThen there\u2019s our parents, who are also complete and total opposites. My mom is the ultimate slob. Washing dishes or cleaning the house are about the last things she wants to do, whereas Mary Anne\u2019s dad is Mr. Organized\u2011Neat Freak. Everything in his life is labeled, including the socks in his dresser. (I may be exaggerating just a little bit.)\n\nEven though Mary Anne and I are really different in many ways, there are a lot of things we agree on. Like helping the environment. I know if Mary Anne had been in Mrs. Gonzalez\u2019s class, she would have raised her hand and said, \u201cI agree with Dawn. We can save the planet if we all pull together.\u201d\n\nAfter I made my announcement in class, Mrs. Gonzalez folded her hands in front of her and smiled at me.",

          "text": "The dry leaves crunched under our sneakers.\n\n\u201cI just love autumn, don\u2019t you?\u201d said Mallory Pike.\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d I replied. \u201cWell, actually I like all seasons. And I like them even better now that I live here in Stoneybrook.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the seasons seem more real in the country. In New\u202fYork they get sort of flattened out. Do you know what I mean? You can barely tell one from the other. In the autumn, you don\u2019t see the leaves change color unless you live near a park. In the winter, hardly any snow falls, and most of what does fall melts, because the city is so warm. Especially the streets and sidewalks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat with the subways and all,\u201d added Mal knowledgeably, even though she has been to New\u202fYork, like, three times.\n\nIt was a Monday afternoon. Mal and I were walking home from school together. We go to Stoneybrook Middle School. Mal is in sixth grade and I am in eighth. (She\u2019s eleven and I\u2019m thirteen.)\n\nI am Stacey McGill. My parents named me Anastasia Elizabeth McGill, but they\u2019re the only ones who ever call me that \u2014 and when they do, I know I am in Deep Trouble. As you may have guessed, I used to live in New\u202fYork City. In fact, I still go there pretty often. That\u2019s because my dad lives there. He and my mom are divorced now.\n\nMy recent life has been rife with drama. (I just love that phrase! I read it in a book.)\n\nMaybe other kids have led more dramatic lives than I have, but mine has to be up there in the top twenty percent or so. (Which reminds me \u2014 I love math, too.) I am a native New\u202fYorker. I was born in the city and I grew up there. My mom and dad and I lived in the same apartment until I was twelve. Then my dad\u2019s company transferred him to Connecticut, so we moved to Stoneybrook. I guess grown\u2011ups aren\u2019t always too good at making up their minds, because after we\u2019d lived in Stoneybrook for less than one year, Dad\u2019s boss transferred him back to New\u202fYork. So we picked up and returned to the city \u2014 but to a different apartment.\n\nOkay. I thought that was that. I had liked Stoneybrook all right, and I had loved my new school and especially my new friends, but I missed the city. I didn\u2019t mind returning. But I did mind that my parents started to fight. Not just a spat every now and then, but lots and lots of long, shouting arguments. Even so, I was taken by surprise when they told me they had decided to divorce. I thought that only happened to other families. Worse, Dad had decided to stay in the city (with his job), but Mom wanted to go back to Stoneybrook \u2014 and I had to choose which of them to live with. In the end I chose Mom, not because I love her more than Dad, but because I found myself missing Stoneybrook and needing my friends here.\n\nThose things happened awhile ago. Now Mom and I are settled into a little old house which is directly in back of Mal\u2019s. And in the city, Dad is settled into a tiny two\u2011bedroom apartment. (The second bedroom is mine, for when I visit my father.)\n\nMallory and I had reached her driveway, the spot where we usually separate. She follows the walk to her front door.",

          "text": "\u201cYou\u2019re coming back at four, right?\u201d Mal called over her shoulder.\n\n\u201cYup. I\u2019ll see you then!\u201d\n\nMal is the oldest of eight children. (Hers is the biggest family I have ever known.) I was going to help her baby\u2011sit for her younger brothers and sisters for an hour, and then we were going to go to a meeting of the Baby\u2011sitters Club together. (My friends and I call it the BSC. I\u2019ll tell you more about it later.)\n\nI cut across the lawns and ran into my house. \u201cHi, Mom! I\u2019m home!\u201d I called. I headed for the refrigerator.\n\n\u201cHi, honey.\u201d Mom entered the kitchen, looking pale and tired. She\u2019s been looking that way a lot lately. It comes from being a single parent who\u2019s job\u2011hunting and doing temporary work.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d I said as Mom sank into a chair. \u201cHow many interviews did you go on today?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d she replied.\n\n\u201cJust two?\u201d I would have guessed about ten.\n\n\u201cJust two. But I\u2019ve lined up several more.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cMom, you don\u2019t have to rush, you know, I mean, about getting a job. Dad\u2019s paying alimony and child support \u2026 isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, of course,\u201d Mom assured me. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t the same. Now his salary is paying for a house and an apartment. The money doesn\u2019t go as far these days. So I do need a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I was carefully putting together a snack. I always have to plan my meals and snacks carefully. This is because I\u2019m a diabetic. Diabetes is a disease in which this gland in your body, the pancreas, stops producing the proper amount of something called insulin. Your body needs insulin to break down sugar. If this system goes out of whack, you can get really sick. (Well, I can. I\u2019m a brittle diabetic, which means I have a severe form of the disease.) Here\u2019s how I control my diabetes: by sticking to a strict no\u2011sugar diet, and by giving myself injections of insulin. I know that\u2019s gross, but it has to be done.\n\n\u201cWhat are your plans this afternoon, honey?\u201d Mom asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting at the Pikes\u2019 with Mal, but just for an hour. Then we\u2019re going to the BSC meeting. I\u2019ll be home by six\u2011fifteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. Where\u2019s Dee going?\u201d (Dee is Mrs. Pike, although that isn\u2019t her real first name. That\u2019s my mom\u2019s nickname for her. She and Mrs. Pike have gotten to be very close friends.)\n\n\u201cA school meeting,\u201d I replied. \u201cThe elementary school. Something about Claire\u2019s kindergarten class, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d Mom nodded absently.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a nap?\u201d I suggested. \u201cYou look exhausted. I can start dinner. And I can finish it after the meeting. We can eat a little late tonight. I\u2019ll bring another snack to the meeting.\u201d (I also have to be careful about when I eat.)\n\n\u201cWell, I think I\u2019ll just take you up on your offer.\u201d Mom.\n\nThe phone rang then, and I told Mom not to bother with it. Whatever it was, I would handle it. \u201cHello?\u201d I said. I closed my eyes, allowing myself to wish that Sam Thomas would be on the other end of the line. Sam",

They were all too busy creating pandemonium.\n\nPandemonium was a new word in the vocabulary builder section of my English textbook. We\u2019d just learned it in class that afternoon. The minute I saw the word, I knew it was one I\u2019d have many chances to use. (I love it when I find a really great new word.) Pandemonium means: wild uproar and noise.\n\nThat\u2019s the Pike house, all right! Uproar and noise. I\u2019m used to that, though. I don\u2019t have much choice since I have seven younger brothers and sisters. In fact, \u201cuproar and noise\u201d is the general state of things on most days.\n\nToday was no different than usual. I was the last one home from school, and the kids were spread all over the rec room. Vanessa was lying on the rug watching a rock video. Claire had strewn pieces of her picture puzzle across the floor. Margo was loudly practicing a cheerleading cheer (even though she is not a cheerleader). The triplets were having a game of monkey\u2011in\u2011the\u2011middle with a small orange Nerf ball. And Nicky was making weird noises with a speaker he\u2019d just bought. (The speaker has three settings: loud, robot voice, and baby voice. When you speak into it, the speaker changes your voice any way you want. It\u2019s actually kind of cool.)\n\n\u201cThis place is complete pandemonium!\u201d I repeated, mostly because no one had paid any attention to me the first time.\n\n\u201cA panda?\u201d inquired five\u2011year\u2011old Claire, looking up from her puzzle.\n\n\u201cNo, not a panda. Pandemonium,\u201d I told her as I wiggled out of my backpack. \u201cIt means \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds like a sickness,\u201d eight\u2011year\u2011old Nicky chimed in, putting down his speaker. He clutched his throat and bulged his eyes. \u201cHelp! I\u2019ve got pandemonium. Call a doctor!\u201d He spun around the room a few times before flinging himself on the floor.\n\n\u201cVery funny,\u201d I said, smiling despite my efforts to look unamused.\n\nVanessa, who is nine, glanced away from her video. \u201cI think pandemonium sounds more like something you clean pans with.\u201d She rolled onto her back and held up her hands. \u201cI no longer have rough, dry hands because now I clean my dishes with Pannnnn\u2011demonium!\u201d she said, as if she were an actress on a commercial.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not dishwashing stuff.\u201d I laughed. \u201cPandemonium means \u2014 hey!\u201d The Nerf ball had bounced off my forehead. \u201cWatch it! You\u2019re not supposed to be playing ball inside, anyway.\u201d I picked up the small, spongy ball which had dropped to my feet and squished it into the pocket of my jeans.\n\n\u201cAw, come on, give it back,\u201d said Adam, annoyed. He\u2019s one of the identical triplets, who are ten.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a Nerf ball. It\u2019s not going to hurt anything.\u201d Jordan backed up Adam. (As usual.)\n\nByron didn\u2019t look like he minded, though. I think he was relieved not to be the monkey\u2011in\u2011the\u2011middle anymore. He\u2019s not as athletic as Adam and Jordan. When he\u2019s the one trying to get the ball away, he can get stuck as the monkey for a long time.\n\nSome people have trouble telling Byron, Adam, and Jordan apart. But to me, they are each so different that I never have a problem. I could pick Byron out just from the way he slouches. Besides, they don\u2019t dress alike. I\u2019m always surprised when people confuse them.",

And did I hear something about a ball in the house?\" The triplets\u2019 guilty expressions gave them away. \"Well, take it ouside. Margo, you can do your cheering outside, too. It\u2019s a gorgeous day.\"\n\n\"We\u2011must\u2011go\u2011outside. We\u2011must\u2011go\u2011outside,\" Nicky chanted with his speaker set to robot\u2011voice as he moved mechanically out of the rec room.\n\n\"Claire, pick up those puzzle pieces, please,\" Mom requested. Then she looked at me. The moment she did, I knew what was coming. I was tipped off by the way she glanced quickly at Claire before she spoke.\n\n\"Mallory,\" Mom said, \"could you please watch Claire for a little while?\" Just as I\u2019d expected.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I love to baby\u2011sit. I love it so much that I\u2019m even a member of a club called the Baby\u2011sitters Club (which I\u2019ll tell you about later). But one thing I don\u2019t like about being the oldest of eight kids is that I\u2019m always being asked to take care of one or more of them. (The other thing I don\u2019t like is the privacy problem. There\u2019s practically no privacy in my house.)\n\nSometimes Mom and Dad ask me to baby\u2011sit when it\u2019s not convenient; like when I want to read, or write in my journal, or just be alone. When I go on a baby\u2011sitting job for the BSC (Baby\u2011sitters Club) I know exactly when and where I\u2019ll be sitting. (The club is super organized.) But at home, baby\u2011sitting assignments can pop up unexpectedly.\n\nMost of the time I just sigh and say okay. (Or smile and say okay, depending on my mood.) But today I really couldn\u2019t do it.\n\n\"I would, Mom, but Ben is coming over,\" I told her. \"We\u2019re going to do our homework together.\"\n\nMom opened her mouth as if she were about to argue with me, but then she seemed to change her mind. \"Okay,\" she said, kneeling and tossing the last of the puzzle pieces in the box. \"I just wanted to make some phone calls. I can make them after supper.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ll watch Claire after supper,\" I offered.\n\nMom smiled. \"It\u2019s a deal.\"",

          "text": "I found a flummp caterpillar!\" Carolyn Arnold shouted from the basement.\n\nWell, at least that was what it sounded like. It was hard to tell, because her twin sister Marilyn was practicing the piano loudly in the living room.\n\nI was in the kitchen. I should say I\u2019d been banished to the kitchen by my two eight-year-old baby-sitting charges. Marilyn, the musician, needed to practice. Carolyn, the science whiz, was working away on some mysterious project. Me? I\u2019d started my math homework, but a flummp caterpillar sounded much more interesting. So I called out, \"You found a what?\" When I got no answer, I repeated, \"You found a what?\"\n\nCarolyn came rushing into the kitchen. \"Mary Aaaanne,\" she said with exasperation, \"you know I can\u2019t hear you when Marilyn\u2019s playing.\"\n\nI bit my lip. Normally I would have reminded her that she\u2019d been calling me, but I didn\u2019t. You see, I had just made a New Year\u2019s resolution: to be the best person I could be, in all possible ways. (Okay, I admit I may have gone overboard with that resolution, but at least I could try.) And that meant being the best possible baby-sitter, along with everything else.\n\n\"Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here now,\" I said with kindness and patience. \"Now, what did you say you found?\"\n\n\"A flux capacitator!\" Carolyn replied, holding up a magnifying glass with the lens missing.\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" I said. \"What\u2019s that?\"\n\nCarolyn rolled her eyes. Then she leaned over and lowered her voice to a whisper. \"Didn\u2019t you see Back to the Future? The flux capacitator is the secret to \u2026 you know \u2026\" She gestured, as if I were supposed to know what she meant.\n\n\"What, time travel?\" I asked.\n\n\"Sshhhh!\" Carolyn shot back. Then she whispered, \"Yes!\"\n\n\"Um, why are we whispering?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because,\" Carolyn explained, \"if anyone finds out about this, they\u2019ll try to steal my idea. I want to be totally finished with it before I let people use it.\"\n\nAs she scampered across the kitchen toward the basement door, I asked, \"Use what, Carolyn?\"\n\nShe pulled the door open, looked over her shoulder with a big smile, and said, \"My time machine!\"\n\nBefore I could reply, she was down the stairs.\n\nThe only sound left was Marilyn\u2019s song. She was playing this dainty classical piece that made me think of people with powdered faces dancing around in wigs and dresses with big bustles.\n\nSo there I was, with the ancient past in the Arnolds\u2019 living room and the future downstairs in the Arnolds\u2019 basement. I felt like some kind of midpoint on a time line. A big dot that says \"You are here.\" And \"here\" was the Arnolds\u2019 kitchen on a cold, dreary Wednesday afternoon in January.",

          "text": "\"You,\" of course, is me, Mary Anne Spier. And I don\u2019t mean to sound like I was miserable that afternoon or anything. I really love baby-sitting. In fact, as a Baby-sitters Club member, I consider it one of the most important things in my life (more about the BSC later). What are the other important things in my life? My family, my kitten (who\u2019s named Tigger and is furry and gray), my boyfriend (who\u2019s named Logan Bruno and is not furry and gray), my best friends (who are all BSC members, too), and SMS (my school, Stoneybrook Middle School). Not necessarily in that order!\n\nWhat else? Oh, I\u2019m thirteen and in eighth grade. I\u2019m pretty shy, which makes it all the more strange that I\u2019m the only BSC member with a steady boyfriend. My friends tease me about being \"too sensitive.\" I have to admit, I do tend to cry a lot, especially at movies. I once took some kids to see Beauty and the Beast. You know when the Beast dies and Belle says she loves him as the last petal falls from the rose? Well, the kids were laughing hysterically during that part \u2014 because I honked when I blew my nose from crying!\n\nI don\u2019t mind the teasing, though. My friends aren\u2019t the least bit mean. We\u2019re all so close, we can take each other seriously and joke about our personalities. It\u2019s funny, but my two best friends in the BSC are anything but shy. One of them also happens to be my stepsister. Her name is Dawn Schafer. We were friends even before we were family. In fact, we were the ones who got our parents together.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of a romantic story. Dawn used to live in California with her parents and younger brother, Jeff. But when her parents got divorced, her mom decided to move back to her hometown \u2014 namely, Stoneybrook.\n\nWell, my dad grew up here, too. In fact, he was in the same class as Sharon (Mrs. Schafer). In fact, he knew her. In fact \u2026 well, Dawn and I got hold of their high school yearbooks, and we read these notes they\u2019d written to each other \u2014 love letters. Yes, they had been sweethearts! At first I couldn\u2019t believe it. Sharon is sort of, well, absent\u2011minded. (I\u2019d use a stronger word, but I have to remember my resolution.) She\u2019s really a wonderful person, but she\u2019s been known to leave her gloves in the freezer, her keys in the bathroom soap\u2011dish, stuff like that. My dad, on the other hand, bought a new pair of white socks last week and marked the toes with Xs so they wouldn\u2019t get mixed up in the laundry with his older white socks. He is Mr. Neatness.\n\nWith a little nudging from Dawn and me, Dad and Sharon started dating again, and the old romance must have come back. (It took a while, though, and I can imagine why. My dad has these habits, like bringing a calculator to restaurants to check if the waiter added correctly on the bill.) Eventually they got married, and the Schafers and Spiers became one family.\n\nBy that time, Jeff had moved back to California. (He never did adjust to Stoneybrook, and he missed his dad terribly.) So Sharon and Dawn had been living all alone in this big old farmhouse. And I mean old. Can you believe it was built in the 1790s? It even has a secret passageway that was once used by slaves escaping north on the Underground Railroad. The passageway leads from the barn right to Dawn\u2019s bedroom. Since my dad and I lived in a much smaller house, we moved into the farmhouse.\n\nI love having a big family. I know four people in one hou",

Instantly I raised my leg even higher behind me and pushed my shoulders back. \u201cMuch better, Mademoiselle Romsey,\u201d she said with a nod. Then she moved along, studying the grand battements of the other students at the barre.\n\n\u201cYou are much too stiff,\u201d I heard her tell a blonde girl named Mary Bramstedt. \u201cRelax your shoulders. Breathe!\u201d\n\nMaybe I should explain a few things before I go any further. For starters, my name is not Mademoiselle Romsey. That\u2019s just how it comes out when my teacher, Mme Noelle, speaks to me in her French accent.\n\nI\u2019m Jessica Ramsey. All my friends call me Jessi. I\u2019m eleven and (among other things) I take ballet lessons at a school in Stamford.\n\nMme Noelle is rather old and very strict, but has a great reputation as a ballet teacher. In fact, the ballet school I go to is considered one of the best on the East Coast. (Not counting the professional schools down in New York City.) I\u2019m really glad to be studying here.\n\nRight now I attend class every Tuesday and Friday, after school. My dad works in Stamford and picks me up on the way home. It takes us about a half hour to drive from Stamford to our home in Stoneybrook.\n\nMme Noelle clapped her hands and I swung my leg out of the grand battement position. A grand battement is a warm\u2011up exercise meant to loosen the hips and hamstring muscles of the legs. (It\u2019s pronounced \u201cgrand\u2011bot\u2011a\u2011mont,\u201d which is French, the language of ballet.)\n\nClass always opens with a series of warm\u2011ups. It\u2019s important that a dancer's muscles be warm and stretched so she doesn\u2019t hurt herself (or himself \u2014 though there are only girls in my class) during the more difficult work that later.",

Ze Stamford Ballet School will be giving a free six\u2011week donce class to some of Stamford\u2019s less privileged children. Ze class will be held every Tuesday at zis time. We need volunteers to help Mme Dupre conduct it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about our own work?\u201d Katie Beth Parsons asked.\n\n\u201cVolunteers will receive six free classes to make up for ze ones zey will miss,\u201d Mme Noelle explained.\n\n\u201cBut won\u2019t we fall behind?\u201d asked Carrie Steinfeld.\n\n\u201cYou must make zis decision for yourself,\u201d Mme Noelle told her. \u201cAt some point in your careers, many of you will wish to teach. Zis will be a valuable experience. Now, do I have any volunteers?\u201d\n\nImmediately my hand shot up. I love working with kids. I baby\u2011sit a lot and I even belong to a group called the Baby\u2011sitters Club. (The club is really important to me. Maybe not as important as ballet, but close. I\u2019ll tell you about it later.)\n\nI wasn\u2019t worried about falling behind in my work. As it is, I\u2019m the youngest in the class. (Katie Beth used to be, before I joined the class, but she\u2019s a year older than me. I think she resents not being the youngest anymore.) And \u2014 though I wouldn\u2019t say this to anyone else \u2014 I\u2019m one of the best. I don\u2019t mean to sound conceited. It\u2019s just true. Not long ago I danced the lead in Sleeping Beauty in the school production. I\u2019ve had other lead parts as well.\n\nThe only other girl who raised her hand was Mary Bramstedt.\n\nTo be honest, I was pretty surprised by two things. The first was that more girls didn\u2019t volunteer. Teaching kids to dance sounded like so much fun, I couldn\u2019t believe everyone wouldn\u2019t want to do it. I guess they didn\u2019t want to take time away from their own classes. (I know dancers have to be serious and competitive, but sometimes I think that they take that too far.)\n\nThe second thing that surprised me was that Mary did volunteer. She\u2019s nice enough, but very intense. She\u2019s a perfectionist who worries about getting every step exactly right. And the odd thing is, she\u2019s not one of the best dancers in class. Not by far. For all her worrying, she\u2019s stiff and sort of robotlike when she dances. It\u2019s as if she can\u2019t stop worrying long enough to let the music carry her. I wouldn\u2019t have expected Mary to feel comfortable taking even a moment away from her regular classes. But \u2014 as I said \u2014 she surprised me, which made me like her a little better than I had.\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d Mme Noelle said to Mary and me. \u201cReport here next Tuesday and Madame Dupre will meet you.\u201d",

We raised one leg way up behind us while we leaned forward for balance. Of course, our arms had to be carefully placed so we didn\u2019t topple over.\n\nMary was in front of me and I noticed her supporting leg was quivering badly. I wanted to suggest she shift her weight backward a bit, but Mme Noelle frowns on any talking during class.\n\nFrom there we worked on pirouettes (which are turns, pronounced \u201cpeer\u2011oh\u2011ets\u201d) and jumps. Finally we came to my favorite part of class. At the end of class each of us dances alone across the studio doing a series of steps that Mme Noelle has strung together. Today her instruction was: Bour\u00e9e with port de bras, into a pas de chat, ending with arabesque pench\u00e9 in first arabesque position.\n\nIt sounds complicated, doesn\u2019t it? But it really isn\u2019t, not once you know what the terms mean. Mme Noelle wanted us to take tiny steps on our toes while moving our arms gracefully up and down. That\u2019s the bour\u00e9e with port de bras.\n\nPas de chat means \u201cstep of the cat.\u201d It\u2019s really fun to do. You jump in the air, touch your toes together lightly, then come down softly. After the pas de chat, Madame simply wanted us to go into the arabesque position we\u2019d practiced during class.\n\nI stood in line, and when my turn came I danced out into the middle of the room. When I\u2019m not just doing moves, but actually dancing, it\u2019s as if my body does all the thinking. My mind shuts off and just hears the music. All th",

I was thinking about that on one of those cool days which was perfect for running around and playing shrieking-shouting-laughing-jumping games; which is what my brother David Michael and my stepbrother Andrew, my stepsister Karen and my adopted sister Emily Michelle were doing, along with Shannon, our Bernese mountain dog puppy. I was sitting under a tree, watching the kids.\n\nPerfect weather aside, it was a typical Saturday on a typical weekend for my family. My mother was running errands while my stepfather Watson, and Nannie, my grandmother, had left in Nannie\u2019s car (the Pink Clinker \u2014 it\u2019s painted pink) to go scope out a sale at the local gardening center. My brother Sam, who is fifteen, was at his part-time job delivering groceries for the A&P. And my other brother, Charlie, had taken his car, the Junk Bucket (you can guess why it\u2019s named that!) to the garage for a tune\u2011up.\n\nAs I watched the kids, Karen held the ball up above her head and said to Shannon, \u201cOkay, Shannon, can you say ball?\u201d\n\nShannon promptly sat down, her furry tail sweeping arcs in the leaves on the ground.\n\n\u201cBall, Shannon,\u201d Karen coaxed her.\n\nI wasn\u2019t too surprised that Karen was urging a dog to talk. She has a very vivid imagination.\n\n\u201cBall,\u201d said Karen again.\n\nShannon barked.\n\n\u201cGood dog,\u201d cried Karen, which made Shannon jump up and bark some more.\n\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Karen told Shannon. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep playing.\u201d",

It might be a typical weekend for me and my family, but I bet it would sound pretty wild to some people. There truly was no place like home \u2014 our home, especially!\n\nAnd since it isn\u2019t exactly typical, I guess I\u2019d better explain a little more about it.\n\nI\u2019m Kristy Thomas. I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where I go to Stoneybrook Middle School, coach a softball team called the Krushers, and am president of the Baby\u2011sitters Club (more about that later). My father walked out on my family when I was just a little kid and lives in California now. We don\u2019t hear from him much anymore.\n\nBut then my mom got married again, to my stepfather, Watson Brewer. Watson is rich, really rich, and we live in a huge house \u2014 a mansion, in fact. That sounds weird all by itself, at least to me, but it\u2019s not too bad. I admit I didn\u2019t want to move at first. But I also have to admit that having all the extra space is nice. In our old house, for example, my brothers Sam and Charlie had to share a room while David Michael\u2019s room was the size of a closet.\n\nBut a mansion like Watson's is big enough for everyone to have his or her own room \u2014 even though we are filling up the rooms pretty fast, as you can see. Watson\u2019s two kids, Karen, who is seven, and Andrew, who is almost five, spend every other weekend with us, plus some holidays and two weeks in the summer. Then there\u2019s Emily Michelle, who\u2019s our adopted sister. (She\u2019s two and a half and is from Vietnam.) Plus there\u2019s Nannie, who\u2019s Mom\u2019s mom. Watson and Mom asked her to come live with us to help out with Emily while the rest of us are at work or at school. So Nannie did.\n\nOf course, Shannon doesn\u2019t have her own room (although she does spend a lot of time in David Michael\u2019s room!), but she\u2019s part of the family. Shannon came to live with us after our collie Louie died. Louie was David Michael\u2019s special dog, and we all still miss him. But Shannon\u2019s pretty special, too.\n\nAnd I better not forget Boo\u2011Boo, Watson\u2019s big old gray cat with yellow eyes (who has very definite opinions and doesn\u2019t mind letting you know them) or the goldfish, Crystal Light the Second and Goldfishie, who belong to Karen and Andrew.",

Emily looked on with that sort of benign attention of two-and-a-half year olds, Andrew more seriously. Andrew\u2019s not crazy about dogs, although he liked Louie and he likes Shannon, too.\n\nKaren ran over to the picnic table and put the ball in the notch of the table legs, then ran back to David Michael and Shannon.\n\n\"Now,\" she said.\n\nDavid Michael let go of Shannon, who bounced up expectantly.\n\nKaren held out her hands. \"Where\u2019s your ball, Shannon?\" she asked.\n\nShannon cocked her head, then looked at everyone else.\n\nDavid Michael and Andrew held out their empty hands to show they didn\u2019t have the ball either.\n\n\"Where\u2019s your ball, Shannon?\" David Michael repeated. \"Find your ball.\"\n\n\"Ball!\" said Emily Michelle and then threw up her hands. She teetered for a minute, then, with a surprised look on her face, sat down hard.\n\nI jumped up, but before I could run to her, Shannon licked Emily Michelle\u2019s face and sat down with her.\n\n\"Ball!\" said Emily Michelle again, and everyone started laughing, including Emily.\n\nThen David Michael helped her up and Karen said, \"We need to give Shannon a hint. Shannon, table.\"\n\nI almost started laughing again at the serious expression on Karen\u2019s face, and the goofy one on Shannon\u2019s as she cocked her head at what Karen said. But I was distracted when I heard voices nearby.\n\nA moment later, I saw Linny and Hannie Papadakis, who live across the street from us and one house down. Linny, who is nine, is David Michael\u2019s good friend. Hannie (that\u2019s short for Hannah) is seven and goes to school at Stoneybrook Academy where she and Karen are in the same class. Hannie is one of Karen\u2019s best friends, along with Nancy Dawes, who lives next door to Karen at her mother\u2019s house. Karen, Hannie, and Nancy call themselves the Three Musketeers.",

          "text": "I was trying to look on the bright side of things. It was Monday, true. But it was Monday afternoon. School was almost over for the day. Just a couple of more classes and I was home free. Well, not free. I had a baby-sitting job after school and my friends and I would go to our usual Baby-sitters Club meeting at 5:30. But I like baby-sitting and BSC meetings. After all, I\u2019m a good baby-sitter, and I am the vice-president of the BSC. But more about our club later. Anyway, at that moment I was posed in what I hoped was an I-am-an-interested-student way near the back of Mrs. Hall\u2019s English class.\n\nYou might guess from the above comments that I am not a model member of the student body at Stoneybrook Middle School, where I am in the eighth grade. But I wouldn\u2019t say my pose was all a pose. I am an interested student \u2014 when it comes to some things.\n\nLike art. I love art. I take classes at school and extra art lessons after school. Someday I hope to be a great artist.\n\nAnd junk food. I am definitely an interested student of junk food. I even managed to combine these two interests \u2014 art and junk food \u2014 when I had my first private art show. It was held in my garage and it was called \u201cDisposable Comestibles.\u201d That means I painted and drew quite a few pictures of Twinkies, potato chips, and other foods with cool textures (and tastes). And to prove what a dedicated artist I am, I didn\u2019t eat a single subject until after I\u2019d finished painting its portrait.\n\nWhat else? Oh, yes. I guess you could say I am a student of fashion, too. I like clothes: colors, textures, surprises. (Which makes me a sort of ongoing work of art, I guess.) But I do think I have a unique style, and a good one, too. In fact (although this may sound conceited), except for one other person at SMS, I think I am the fashion czar, or czarina, or whatever. The other person is Stacey, who is my best friend and the treasurer of the Baby-sitters Club.\n\nWho am I? Well \u2026\n\n\u201cClaudia? Claudia Kishi!\u201d I jumped about a mile. It was the mile from wherever my thoughts were to where my body was sitting in Mrs. Hall\u2019s class.\n\n\u201cUh,\u201d I said.\n\nI heard someone behind me snicker.\n\nI braced myself for the grief I was sure Mrs. Hall was going to dish out, but instead she just gave me a reproachful look and turned to survey the room. Several hands shot up, and I leaned back in my seat, embarrassed but relieved.\n\nAfter that I tried to concentrate. I really did. But someone started reading a poem, and when I heard the title, which was \u201cWhen I Am Old I Shall Wear Purple,\u201d my mind skipped to my grandmother Mimi.\n\nMimi was the person I was closest to in my family. I mean, I love my family. But my sister, Janine, is a genuine genius (she even takes courses at the local college even though she\u2019s still in high school!), which makes her a little hard to communicate with sometimes. My parents, who are terrific, just don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m not a good student. They\u2019re always saying things like, \u201cJust put your mind to it, Claudia. If you\u2019d concentrate on your studies just one tenth as much as you do on your art, you\u2019d be a straight-A student.\u201d\n\nBut Mimi understood. She never tried to change me. She supported me and loved me the way I was. And she listened. I\u2019d go to her with problems and she\u2019d let me talk about them without interrupting or telling me what I\u2019d done wrong, or what I should do to make things right. Then she would look at me and say, \u201cMy Claudia, what to do?\u201d\n\nBut Mimi is gone now. She had a stroke, and was sick for a while. Then, one day, she was gone.\n\nI still miss her, my Mimi \u2026",

Mrs. Hall was calling on me again!\n\nBut then I realized that the bell was ringing and everyone around me was standing up, and Mrs. Hall was motioning me toward her desk.\n\nI quickly gathered up my books, stuffed them in my bag, and approached Mrs. Hall\u2019s desk. I tried not to look as guilty as I felt about not hearing a word in class.\n\nMrs. Hall studied me for a moment and I shifted nervously from one foot to the other.\n\nFinally she said, \u201cClaudia, as you know we have an English test coming up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten,\u201d I said brightly. And I hadn\u2019t, really. I just hadn\u2019t been thinking about it. After all, it was only Monday.\n\nAnd the test was a long way away. Plenty of time to worry later.\n\n\u201cClaudia, are you listening to me?\u201d Mrs. Hall was looking annoyed.\n\nHastily I replayed her words in my head. \u201cMy performance,\u201d I repeated her last two words.\n\nMy performance. Uh-oh. This sounded ominous.\n\nMrs. Hall nodded. \u201cAs it stands now, your performance in this class is not good. In fact, unless your spelling improves markedly, you are in danger of failing English this grading period.\u201d\n\n\u201cFailing!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\nIt was a stupid question, of course, but my reaction seemed to make Mrs. Hall a little more sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so, Claudia. And half of this test will cover vocabulary and spelling. If you don\u2019t do well on this test \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean just pass, you\u2019ll have to do better than that \u2014 I am sorry to say you will in all probability fail.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t think of much to say. Finally I settled for, \u201cOh.\u201d\n\nMrs. Hall pressed her hands together and leaned toward me. \u201cClaudia, why don\u2019t I arrange for you to spend some time in the resource room again? It\u2019s helped before.\u201d\n\nI could think of what to say to that. \u201cNo!\u201d\n\nMrs. Hall looked a little startled, so I lowered my voice and tried to sound less panicked and more reasonable. \u201cI mean, no, thank you.

It\u2019s for cleaning the bathroom. You spray it on things and the dirt is supposed to just disappear.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d I giggled. \u201cThat squirty stuff.\u201d I moved to the bottom of the stairs and shouted up, \u201cThe Wipe Away tile cleaner is under the bathroom sink.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere it is!\u201d Mom shouted. \u201cSilly me. It was there all the time and I never even noticed it.\u201d\n\nI hate to say it, but my mom is basically a slob. She usually hates housecleaning, but this Saturday was different. She was actually happy to scrub the bathroom floor. You see, we were all getting ready for my brother Jeff\u2019s visit.\n\nI\u2019m Dawn Schafer. I\u2019m thirteen and I live in Connecticut with my mom. Jeff, who is ten, lives in California with my dad. You\u2019ve probably guessed that my parents are divorced. When the split happened, Mom brought Jeff and me back to the town of Stoneybrook, where she grew up. It was rough on all of us. Lucky for me, I met Mary Anne Spier and we liked each other instantly. Then Mary Anne introduced me to the members of the Baby\u2011sitters Club (I\u2019ll tell you more about them later) and soon I had lots of friends. But Jeff was always getting in fights with this kid named Jerry Haney, and doing badly in school. He really hated being here. That\u2019s why Mom decided he would be happier if he went back to California and lived with Dad. Jeff is much happier now, but I miss him. And my old home. You see, I\u2019m a California girl at heart.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, I have long hair (almost to my waist), that\u2019s pale blonde, and blue eyes that some people say are the color of the ocean. I like sunshine and healthy food like carrot sticks and granola. I wear clothes that are comfortable. And I am very independent.\n\nBack to Mary Anne. She\u2019s my best friend. And guess what? Now she\u2019s also my stepsister! Her dad (Richard) married my mom (Sharon). This is how it happened. Mary Anne and I discovered that our parents had dated in high school. We found all this romantic stuff they\u2019d written to each other in their senior yearbooks. So we decided to try to get them back together. You see, Mr. Spier\u2019s wife died when Mary Anne was little. After that he became this stern lonely guy who was really strict with Mary Anne. (He used to make her wear little kid dresses and fix her hair in pigtails.) Mom\u2019s divorce was hard and she was lonely, too. Anyway, it was the perfect time for them to meet. They started dating and fell in love all over again. Isn\u2019t that cool? And then they decided to get married and now Mom is Mrs. Spier.\n\nWe all live in this creaky old farmhouse that\u2019s nearly two hundred years old. It was built in 1795 and it even has a secret passage that might be haunted. The passage leads from the barn to my room. I found out that during the Civil War it was used as a hiding place for the Underground Railroad. Isn\u2019t that neat?\n\nI really like my new family, but I have to say that there\u2019s been a hole inside of me ever since Jeff went back to California. It was hard enough living without Dad but when my brother left, it took me a long time to get over it.",

I\u2019m always finding hedge clippers in the bread drawer or her high heels in the refrigerator or the TV remote control in the bathroom cabinet. Richard, on the other hand, is Mr. Organized. He arranges his books alphabetically and color codes his socks. He\u2019s a clean fiend and likes dishes and counters to shine.\n\n\"Make sure those sheets have hospital corners,\" Richard said, pointing to the bed. \"We want everything shipshape for Jeff.\"\n\n\"Hospital corners?\" I had no idea what he was talking about.\n\nRichard untucked the top sheet that I had just spent five minutes smoothing out. \"Here, I\u2019ll show you. It\u2019s the most efficient way to make a bed. Hospitals developed this technique because they change sheets more often than any other institution.\" I watched as he tucked a corner under the bed, making sure he had a straight crease on the remaining part, and then folded that under the mattress. The corner of the sheet looked like the back of an envelope.\n\n\"There!\" He stepped back and surveyed his work proudly. \"What do you think?\"\n\nI didn\u2019t want to tell him that I thought my way had looked just as nice so I said, \"It looks really neat and tidy.\"\n\nRichard smiled and nodded. \"That\u2019s good. Jeff will appreciate that, I\u2019m sure.\"\n\nI was sure Jeff wouldn\u2019t even notice. You see, Jeff is like Mom and me \u2014 pretty relaxed about things.

          "text": "Actually, lilacs are pretty exotic to me. Where I come from, New\u202fYork City, there aren\u2019t any. Well, there are, but they\u2019re in buckets of water at corner markets, and they\u2019ve been picked already so the aroma is almost gone. I do miss a lot of things about New\u202fYork, but Stoneybrook definitely smells better at this time of year. How do you know it\u2019s a spring day in New\u202fYork City?\n\n1. By touching the radiator to see if the super has turned off the heat.\n\n2. By listening to the weather report.\n\n3. By looking out the window to see what people are wearing. (This choice only applies if you have an apartment facing the street.)\n\nCan you tell I\u2019m a real New\u202fYorker? I am. I was born there. I\u2019m an only child, and my parents took me everywhere \u2014 shows, restaurants, museums, concerts, festivals, you name it. So I\u2019m really comfortable in the city, despite the grime and crime and other bad stuff. But around the time I started seventh grade, my dad\u2019s company transferred him to Stoneybrook. So it was Bye\u2011Bye Big Apple.\n\nTo me, Stoneybrook was \u201cthe country.\u201d Actually, it\u2019s a small town in Connecticut, but it\u2019s awfully cozy and quiet compared to NYC. It\u2019s also the home of my best friends and the Baby\u2011sitters Club (which I\u2019ll tell you about later).\n\nNow I\u2019m thirteen and in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. But I haven\u2019t been in Stoneybrook the whole time. For a while last year we moved to New\u202fYork again, when Dad\u2019s company transferred him back. By that time I\u2019d adjusted and made my new friends here. Leaving them was sad. But it was fun to see my old neighborhood (in a new apartment) and my old friends.\n\nWell, the fun didn\u2019t last long. My parents had been getting on each other\u2019s nerves for a while. Soon they were arguing all the time. Then the fights became long shouting matches. Before I knew it, they sprang the bad news on me. They were getting a divorce.\n\nI was kind of expecting it, but it still shocked me. Here was the worst part: Dad decided to stay in New\u202fYork, but Mom wanted to go back to Stoneybrook. And they asked me to choose which place I wanted to live in! It was, like, \u201cDo you want to be with me or not?\u201d I was afraid to decide on either place. After a long time (and a lot of crying) we finally made a deal. I would live with my mom in Stoneybrook \u2014 but I had to be allowed to make lots of visits to New\u202fYork! (It\u2019s only a train ride away.)\n\nSo here I am. Mom and I live in a nice, small house. The divorce seems to be working out all right, I guess. (Well, at least they\u2019re not slugging it out.) Dad sends his alimony and child care payments regularly (yay, Dad!) but Mom decided to supplement them by taking a job as a buyer at Bellair\u2019s Department Store (yay, Mom!).\n\nSo I guess that makes me a Divorced Kid and a Latchkey Kid. I don\u2019t mind the Latchkey part. It\u2019s the Divorced part that\u2019s hard. For a long time, I felt as if I had to be Super Daughter. I thought I needed to please both parents all the time. And my parents weren\u2019t making things easy for me, either. Each of them always grilled me about the other, as if they were arguing through me. Finally everything came to a head. It started when my mom got really sick recently. She was laid up in bed on the night I was supposed to go to an important dinner for my dad in New\u202fYork. I tried to be my mom\u2019s nursemaid and make the trip. Well, everything got botched up. I overscheduled Mom\u2019s caretakers. I cut my NYC trip short, which made Dad angry. I ended up exhausting myself.\n\nSo I did some thinking. I realized I\u2019d been trying way too hard. I had a long talk with my mom. She told me I should learn to take care of myself first, which was a good idea. Since then I\u2019ve been trying to follow that advice.\n\nFunny how divorce complicates everything.",

          "text": "\"Happy families are all alike.\" That\u2019s a quote, sort of, in case you wondered, from a book called Anna Karenina by a Russian writer named Leo Tolstoy. It\u2019s the very first line of the book, which has about a million more lines \u2014 it\u2019s a long book.\n\nHave I read it? Don\u2019t worry. I haven\u2019t. At least not yet. But as a member of the Baby-sitters Club (more about that later), I\u2019ve had the chance to meet someone who has. Our Baby-sitters Club vice-president Claudia Kishi\u2019s older sister, Janine, who is a genuine genius, has read the whole book. Once when I was at Claudia\u2019s I told Janine about a homework assignment: to write a memorable, unforgettable opening sentence for a story. That\u2019s when she told me the quote.\n\nI was thinking about that quote on a warm, sunny summer Saturday while I was eating breakfast with my family. My stepsister Dawn Schafer was polishing off a bowl of granola with plain yogurt and fruit. My father was carefully cutting a second bagel in half, and spreading it with precisely one tablespoon of cream cheese. My stepmother Sharon was frowning down at her place as if she had mislaid something (she\u2019s a little, well, disorganized). I was eating a toasted bagel with lots and lots of butter and raspberry jam.\n\nI stopped to look around the table and thought about what Tolstoy had said, and wondered if it were true. I knew we were a happy family, but I was pretty sure we didn\u2019t like any other families I knew.\n\nFor example, Dawn was my best friend before she was my stepsister. And I have a stepbrother, Jeff, who is Dawn\u2019s younger brother, but who lives in California with his and Dawn\u2019s father. And Sharon and my father used to date (years and years ago) right here in Stoneybrook where we live. And \u2026",

I\u2019m the secretary of the Baby-sitters Club (my friends and I call it the BSC) and I live in a spooky old farmhouse with my father and my stepmother and Dawn. Dawn is also in the eighth grade at SMS and a member of the BSC.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t always that way. I was an only child. My mother died when I was just a baby, and my father raised me on his own. Meanwhile, Dawn\u2019s parents got divorced and Dawn\u2019s mother decided to move back to Stoneybrook, because it was her hometown. She brought Dawn and Jeff with her.\n\nDawn and I became friends and she joined the Baby-sitters Club (she\u2019s the alternate officer). And then we discovered that her mother and my father used to know each other when they were in high school and living in Stoneybrook.\n\nHow did Dawn and I turn out to be such great detectives? Well, we found my dad\u2019s and Dawn\u2019s mother\u2019s high school yearbooks. Inside were these really sweet love notes they\u2019d written to each other at the end of their senior year. That\u2019s when Dawn and I realized that not only had her mother and my father known each other, they\u2019d been in love!\n\nPretty romantic. It was more romantic when (with a little help from Dawn and me), Dad and Sharon began to date again. And even though they are very different people, they fell in love and got married. So Dad and I (and my gray kitten Tigger) moved out of our house and into Dawn\u2019s house and now we are one big (well, bigger than just my dad and me) happy family.",

          "text": "But happy families can\u2019t all be alike, I don\u2019t know any family that is just like mine. Not only are we completely different from other families, but the members of my family are pretty different from each other.\n\nFor example, my father is a very organized, meticulous person. He always buttons his coats and sweaters and shirts the same way, from bottom to top, because that way he won\u2019t waste any time making a mistake and having the buttons come out uneven so he has to do it all over again. He alphabetizes things, like the stuff in the bathroom cabinet. And he used the same strict, by-the-book method to raise me. Don\u2019t misunderstand me. I love my father very much. He\u2019s a warm and caring person. But since he had to be both my mother and my father, he was very careful. Until not long ago, I used to have to wear my hair in braids and dress in conservative, little girl clothes. And when most of my friends got their ears pierced, I wasn\u2019t allowed to. Gradually I managed to convince him to be a little less strict (to let me wear my hair loose and get some more stylish clothes), but marriage to Sharon was what really loosened him up. (Now I can even wear a little makeup, but still no pierced ears. Yet!)\n\nSharon\u2019s personality couldn\u2019t be more different than my father\u2019s. She might not notice if her sweater or coat were buttoned up the wrong way \u2014 or maybe even if it were inside out or backwards. If she were going to organize the bathroom cabinet, she\u2019d probably arrange things according to color, or shape. And it\u2019s a definite possibility that sooner or later you\u2019d look in the cabinet and find something that didn\u2019t belong at all, like a letter stamped and ready to be mailed. Sharon is absentminded that way. But she\u2019s a wonderful person, and she and my father are really happy together.\n\nDawn and I are pretty opposite, too. For instance, our looks. I\u2019m monochromatic, with brown hair and brown eyes. Dawn has incredible long, pale, pale blonde hair and blue eyes. Also, she will eat only healthy food: tofu, granola, yogurt, sprouts, hardly any sweets, and no red meat. She loves to read ghost stories. And she\u2019s a real individualist: she has two holes pierced in each ear. She dresses in whatever way she feels like dressing, and doesn\u2019t worry about wearing what everybody else is wearing. And although Dawn is very perceptive and kindhearted and even-tempered, she\u2019s not afraid to take a stand on what she believes in, like protecting the environment.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the things I admire most about Dawn, and one of the ways in which we are really different. I\u2019m very shy and I hate confrontations. I guess that\u2019s because I\u2019m sensitive. I cry easily over stuf",

          "text": "\"You know what else? My brother, Jeff, lives in California with my dad. He did move here originally with Mom and me, but he wasn\u2019t happy at all. He started having trouble in school and being really moody, and we finally realized he was homesick for Dad (and California). So after a lot of arguing and crying, my parents decided to let him live with Dad. I really, really, really miss him. He\u2019s ten years old, and I don\u2019t know, I feel weird not being around to see him grow up. I\u2019ve been thinking about visiting Dad and Jeff again a lot lately.\"\n\n\"I have been out there a few times. It\u2019s fun, but boy, is it hard to say good\u2011bye. Plus my dad has this girlfriend named Carol, which makes things complicated. At first I didn\u2019t care for Carol. Okay, the truth \u2014 I couldn\u2019t stand her. She was always trying to act super\u2011young, as if she could be my age, but she\u2019s like thirty\u2011two or so. Actually, I don\u2019t mind her now. She acted her age once, and I was pretty impressed. I mean it, too. It happened when the whole Baby\u2011Sitters Club went out there to visit. (The BSC is a club I belong to. I\u2019ll tell you about it later.) One of our members, Stacey McGill, got a crush on some guy and started hanging around with him and his friends. Well, they were pretty wild \u2014 wild enough to wind up having a car accident. Nobody was hurt, thank goodness. But when Carol found out, instead of keeping it a secret (to be cool and get on our good side), she told my dad. I know it may sound weird, but I respected her after that. She was acting like a responsible grown\u2011up.\"\n\n\"Dad\u2019s thinking of marrying Carol, and that\u2019s another reason I want to go out there so badly. I mean, if she\u2019s going to be his wife (my stepmother) I should get to know her a little, right?\"",

It means that we haven\u2019t just sat around doing nothing.) First of all, I joined the Baby\u2011Sitters Club. Because of that, I made eight fantastic friends, including Mary Anne Spier. And Mom has gotten involved with all kinds of local organizations. She also got involved with a guy! Who? Well, he was her high school sweetheart and his name is Richard Spier.\"\n\n\"Yes, the father of Mary Anne, who, as you know, became my stepsister! You see, Mary Anne\u2019s mom died when she was a baby. Mary Anne doesn\u2019t even remember her, and Richard didn\u2019t talk about her at all for years. Her death left him shocked and heartbroken, and he could barely make it through the day. He even left Mary Anne with her grandparents for a long time, until he could pull himself together. Eventually he took her back and raised her by himself. Now, he is not exactly Mr. Laid Back. With Mary Anne, he became incredibly strict. He made her wear little\u2011girl clothes, keep her hair in pigtails, and come in for super\u2011early curfews until seventh grade. Mary Anne hated that, but she forgives him. She says he was just worried about being a perfect mother and father. Whatever.\"\n\n\"Fortunately, he treats her like a true thirteen\u2011year\u2011old now. He\u2019s still kind of stuffy, and super\u2011organized. (Make that mega\u2011organized. Turbo\u2011organized. I mean, he wears his shirts in a strict order each day so they wear out evenly.) But my mom liberated him. Now, how would you picture a woman who\u2019d fall in love with Richard Spier? Guess again. My mom couldn\u2019t be more different. She\u2019s \u2026 well, easy\u2011going, fun\u2011loving, carefree, absentminded\u2026\"",

My two\u2011year\u2011old brother was about to totter off the end of the coffee table.\n\nHe stood wide\u2011eyed, flapping his arms wildly for balance. With a bound, I sprang across the room and caught him before he hit the floor.\n\nWhew!\n\n\"Is he all right, Jessi?\" asked my eight\u2011year\u2011old sister, Becca, rushing in from the kitchen.\n\nI soothed Squirt, who was now squirming in my arms. \"He\u2019s just scared. I forgot that he\u2019s climbing on everything lately. I can\u2019t take my eyes off him for a second.\"\n\nSquirt\u2019s Pokey Puppy video was still playing on the TV. Not long ago, he would have sat quietly on his big down pillow and watched it peacefully. But in the last few weeks he\u2019d turned into a little mountain goat, scrambling up everything he could find.\n\n\"He\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s finish the game,\" said Becca as Squirt\u2019s sobs faded. \"I was just about to buy Boardwalk.\"\n\n\"Bring the Monopoly game in here,\" I suggested. \"That way we can keep an eye on Squirt while we play.\"\n\nBecca sighed loudly. \"Do we have to? I\u2019ll have to move all that money and the cards and everything. The houses will slide around. Why can\u2019t he come into the kitchen while we play?\"\n\n\"Because then he\u2019ll pull the pots out of the cupboard and we\u2019ll have to listen to him bang them,\" I explained. Squirt loves to bang, and it\u2019s hard on the ears if you\u2019re trying to do something else.\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" Becca grumbled.\n\nSquirt looked at me, his long black lashes wet with tears. \"Me boom.\" He pouted.\n\nI smiled at him and nodded, stroking his soft hair. Baby\u2011sitting for a toddler and an eight\u2011year\u2011old at the same time wasn\u2019t easy. There wasn\u2019t much you could do that would entertain both of them.

Our old neighborhood had been integrated, and color just wasn\u2019t a big deal. When we came to Stoneybrook it was the first time I\u2019d ever felt different in any way.\n\nBut we stuck it out and things are much better. Our neighbors know who we are as people now. If any of them are still bothered, they keep it to themselves. And I\u2019ve made some super terrific friends.

But maybe I have a little less patience with my own brother and sister. Or perhaps I was just feeling overwhelmed with everything I had to do that week. My schedule suddenly seemed to have hit complete overload.\n\nAs it is, my schedule is plenty tight. I have school, ballet lessons twice a week, BSC meetings three times a week (BSC is short for Baby\u2011sitters Club), and baby\u2011sitting jobs all week long. (Since my best friend Mallory Pike and I are eleven, we only sit in the afternoons \u2014 or sometimes in the evenings for our own brothers and sisters. We\u2019re junior BSC members.)\n\nAll of this kept me busy enough, but then Dawn (one of the members) left just recently. Since then I\u2019ve had to take more baby\u2011sitting jobs than ever before. In fact, all the members have had to do that, and it\u2019s been hard on everyone.\n\nDawn was, and still is, a member of the BSC. The problem is that right now she\u2019s in California. She\u2019s living with her father and brother for the next six months. You see, Dawn is originally from California, but she and her brother came here with their mom when their parents divorced. Her brother then went back to California to live with their dad, so now Dawn\u2019s original family is split between two coasts. Dawn\u2019s mom remarried (she married her old high school sweetheart who happens to be the father of Mary Anne, another BSC member, but that\u2019s another story which I\u2019ll fill you in on later). Anyway, Dawn started missing her dad and her brother, Jeff, and California in general, so she went back to live with them for a while.\n\nNow we were one member short and swamped with work. Help!",

I spilled the can of punch on the board when I was trying to move it.

(I\u2019m in sixth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. So is Mallory, and so is Wendy.) \"How\u2019s it going?\" Wendy asked.\n\n\"A little crazy.

          "text": "\"Everybody, listen!\" Mom shouted to my family in the living room. \u201cI\u2019ve got great news!\u201d\n\nNobody heard her. They were all too busy talking at once. You see, it was Saturday, October thirtieth, the day before Halloween. Seven kids were swarming around one big trunk filled with costumes in the center of the room and let me tell you, it was a real zoo.\n\nI\u2019m Mallory Pike and I\u2019m eleven, the oldest of all of those kids. Life at my house is usually pretty crazy but today things were totally bonkers. I don\u2019t know if it was all the excitement of preparing for Halloween or the cold that I had, but I was feeling pretty tired. I lay on the couch and watched as Margo, my seven-year-old sister, got into a tug-of-war with Claire, who\u2019s five and the baby of our family.\n\n\u201cI want to be the ballerina!\u201d Margo cried.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already been a ballerina,\u201d Claire said, wrenching the tutu from Margo\u2019s hands.\n\nVanessa, who is nine, stepped between them. \u201cClaire\u2019s right. It\u2019s her turn to wear the costume.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you be a dog?\u201d eight-year-old Nicky suggested. He was wearing a pirate\u2019s eye patch over his glasses.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a dog,\u201d Margo said, pouting. \u201cThey\u2019re ugly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDogs are cool,\u201d Adam shot back. Adam is one of the triplets, who are a year younger than me and identical. He gestured to Byron and Jordan, who were posed with black masks covering their eyes. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t want to be a dog, why not be a Ninja warrior with us?\u201d\n\n\u201cOr a gypsy fortune teller like me?\u201d Vanessa suggested. \u201cI\u2019m going to wear lots of makeup and Mom\u2019s bracelets and jewelry.\u201d\n\nMargo liked that idea and for a moment the shouting died down. That gave Mom, who was still standing in the doorway, just enough time to make her announcement.\n\n\u201cWill the Pike family please try to keep it to a dull roar while I tell you my news?\u201d\n\nWe turned to look at Mom, who smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s better. I just got a call from my cousins in New York.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Strausses?\u201d Dad asked as he took a seat next to me on the couch.\n\nMom nodded. \u201cMarie and Phil were both on the line. They want us to meet them in New York for Thanksgiving. We\u2019ll watch the Macy\u2019s parade, then go out for dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Macy\u2019s parade?\u201d Jordan asked, wide-eyed.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Mom grinned. \u201cThe official parade. Phil was given bleacher seat tickets right in front of Macy\u2019s!\u201d\n\n\u201cWow! We\u2019ll get to see the groups do their dance numbers and sing their songs!\u201d I cried.\n\nDad smiled. \u201cAfter watching it on TV all these years, it would be fun to actually see it in person.\u201d\n\n\u201cA parade!\u201d Margo picked up her toy baton and put a glitter-covered New Year\u2019s hat on her head. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll be. A majorette. Follow me, everybody!\u201d\n\nNicky and Claire fell in behind Margo and marched around the living room, singing, \u201cWe\u2019re going to the city, the city, the city, we\u2019re going to the city and we\u2019ll be on TV.\u201d\n\nMy family calls New York \u201cthe city\u201d because it\u2019s not far from where we live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. We only have to hop on the train and we\u2019re there in an hour or so. Of course, a family as big as mine doesn\u2019t hop on a train that often. That\u2019s why I was so excited about the idea of spending Thanksgiving in New York. I imagined us all in red-and-white-striped stocking caps and mufflers, sitting on the special bleachers oohing and ahing over the parade. I could just see Nicky making faces at the TV cameras and the triplets trying to get autographs from all of the famous people.\n\n\u201cWill we stay at the Strausses\u2019 apartment?\u201d Vanessa asked, as she marched around the living room for the fourth time.\n\n\u201cGood heavens, no,\u201d Mom replied. \u201cWhere would they put all ten of us? No, we\u2019ll have to stay at a hotel.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmmmm.\u201d Dad scratched his chin. \u201cThings get pretty booked up around Thanksgiving. It might be tough to get reservations.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Mom pursed her lips. \u201cAnd finding room for us at a restaurant could be tough, too.\u201d\n\nI could tell by their tone of voice that they were starting to have second thoughts. Which meant that any minute they would change their minds and say we should stay home for Thanksgiving. I decided I\u2019d better speak up.\n\n\u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. I\u2019m sure some hotels are booked up by now, but New York has thousands of hotels. They can\u2019t all be full. And the same goes with restaurants.\u201d\n\nMom looked at Dad. \u201cMallory\u2019s got a point.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might take a few more calls,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I bet we could get reservations. Do you want me to help call?\u201d\n\nMom sat on the couch next to me and felt my forehead. \u201cNo, I think you should rest. You look a little tired.\u201d\n\nI hated to admit it but I didn\u2019t feel just a little tired, I felt a lot tired. It must have been this virus I caught after Dawn (one of our BSC members) moved back to California. What\u2019s the BSC? It stands for the Baby\u2011sitters Club, which is just about the most important thing in my life. But I\u2019ll tell you about our club later.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019d been feeling really rundown lately. I know I must sound like one of those Geritol commercials for old people but I\u2019m serious. Sometimes I could barely keep my eyes open in class. When I came home from school, I was too tired to do my homework or even watch TV or eat dinner. And if anyone in my family gets the teeniest, tiniest little cold, I catch it. I just wished I would get over this.\n\nI spent the rest of Saturday night on the couch watching the Halloween modeling show. First Margo was a majorette, then a cowgirl, then a mermaid, and finally a princess. I think I fell asleep while she was looking for construction paper to make her crown.\n\nDad must have carried me to my room because I woke up the next morning in my bed.",

          "text": "\u201cWatch out!\u201d\n\nThe shout startled me. Before I could turn around, something hit my shoulder. It threw me off balance. My books went flying, my feet shot out from under me, and I fell.\n\nI, Stacey McGill, was a victim of the winter\u2019s first snowball. Or one of the first, anyway.\n\nUntil that moment, it had been a great morning. Snow had fallen overnight, even though it was only early December. I had wolfed down my breakfast, put on my new plum-colored corduroy pants and white down jacket for the first time, and taken a nice, slow walk to school with my friend Claudia. The sun was blazing away, and Stoneybrook had never looked so gorgeous.\n\nNow, I adore snow. But right then, sitting in it was not what I\u2019d had in mind.\n\nAs Claudia helped me to my feet, I could see I\u2019d left two plum-colored streaks in the snow. \u201cOhhhh, look,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHmm, I guess you better wash those pants separately,\u201d Claud remarked.\n\nI was too annoyed to laugh. \u201cThanks,\u201d I replied, brushing myself off.\n\nA big shadow loomed behind me. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to hit you.\u201d\n\nI looked up.\n\nAnd up \u2026 and up.\n\nMy attacker must have been at least six feet tall. I was eye level with his jacket, which had a varsity letter sewn to it \u2014 the letters SMS with a basketball across the middle. (SMS, by the way, stands for Stoneybrook Middle School.)\n\nWhen I reached his face, my anger melted away. I knew who he was. Everyone in SMS did. RJ Blaser was a star of the SMS basketball team.\n\nI should explain something. This winter our school had been swept up by basketball fever. Our team was number one. Totally undefeated. Even I had started going to the games, and I\u2019m no jock. The Stoneybrook News, which never writes about SMS, had printed a big article about the team.\n\nTo be hit by a snowball from behind was no fun. To be hit by RJ Blaser? Well, that was different. I felt kind of honored. I had noticed RJ around school (who hadn\u2019t?), but this was the first time he had ever looked me in the eye.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d I squeaked. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 soft \u2026\u201d\n\nHe looked confused. \u201cYour shoulder?\u201d\n\nClaudia rolled her eyes. \u201cNo, the snow.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard enough to hurt,\u201d I quickly added. \u201cReally.\u201d\n\nWe stared at each other, smiling and saying nothing. Claudia brushed off the back of mv corduroys with sharp, strong swipes.\n\n\u201cUm, my name is RJ,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I replied without thinking. \u201cI mean, I went to a basketball game last week and they were calling out your name over the loudspeaker a lot.\u201d\n\nRJ\u2019s face brightened. \u201cWas that the 64\u201359 over Mercer or the 70\u201360 over Lawrenceville?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2026 uh \u2026 Mercer one, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. I scored twenty-seven points and collected five fouls.\u201d\n\nHuh? I thought he said fowls, and I couldn\u2019t remember any chickens running around the basketball court. But I said, \u201cWow,\u201d because I could tell I was supposed to be impressed.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why they were calling my name,\u201d RJ added. Then he pointed toward the school and said, \u201cThat\u2019s Marty Bukowski. You probably heard his name, too. He\u2019s the one I was throwing the snowball at.\u201d\n\nI looked across the lawn and recognized Marty. He was with Malik Jaffrey and Wayne McConville, two other drop\u2011dead cute basketball stars. With them were four of the most popular girls in the school: Darcy Redmond, Sheila McGregor, Margie Greene, and Penny Weller \u2014 all cheerleaders.\n\n\u201cI guess you better stick to basketballs, huh?\u201d Claudia piped up.\n\nRJ gave her a blank look. \u201cSay what?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, instead of snowballs?\u201d Claudia glanced at me warily. She must have thought she was intruding on something, because she started backing away. \u201cJust a joke. Uh, I better get going. I have some questions for my homeroom teacher. See you later.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay \u2014\u201d I began, but Claudia was booking.\n\nAs she passed RJ\u2019s friends, one of them yelled, \u201cYo, Blaser. It\u2019s cold. We\u2019re going in.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d RJ called back. \u201cLater!\u201d\n\nThe group started walking toward school. I was a little disappointed. It would have been cool to meet them.\n\n\u201cIt is kind of late,\u201d RJ said. \u201cWant to walk with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d I replied.\n\nAs we headed in, I didn\u2019t feel the wetness at the back of my corduroys at all. I didn\u2019t feel much of anything. I wondered if anyone was actually witnessing my walk with RJ Blaser.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re \u2026 ?\u201d RJ was asking me a question.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I answered.\n\nHe flashed a big smile. \u201cNo, your name. You didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d I must have turned red, because I could feel my ears heating up. \u201cI\u2019m Stacey McGill.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and looked earnestly at the ground. For a moment neither of us said anything. Then, as RJ held open the front door of the school for me, he asked, \u201cDid you see Mall Warriors II yet \u2014 you know, the movie?\u201d\n\nI shook my head. \u201cUh-uh.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. We can see it Friday night. It\u2019s playing in town. Okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, sure.\u201d\n\nRrrriinnngg! The homeroom bell echoed through the school.\n\nRJ began trotting down the front hall as if it were a basketball court. \u201cMy dad can drive us,\u201d he called over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll get your address later. See you.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2019Bye!\u201d I called.\n\nKids were scurrying to their classrooms. I stood rooted to the spot until no one else was in the hall. It took me a moment to realize I hadn\u2019t picked up my books from the snowy sidewalk. I\u2019d have to run out and get them, and I\u2019d be late for homeroom.\n\nBut you know what? I didn\u2019t care.\n\nI was going to go out with RJ Blaser.",

          "text": "After that, I went straight upstairs and began hugging myself.\n\nWho was this boy of my dreams I was pretending to hug? Good question. I hadn\u2019t met him yet. I\u2019ve gone out on dates, but it\u2019s never been anything serious. That super\u2011special, tingly, in\u2011love thing has never happened to me. (By the way, \u201cme\u201d is Claudia. Claudia Kishi.)\n\nWell, I\u2019d thought I\u2019d had the in\u2011love feeling before. When I went on a vacation to California, I met a boy I really liked a lot. And before that I\u2019d liked a couple of other boys. But nothing has come of any of it. I mean, none of those boys ever became my steady boyfriend or anything like that. And I wasn\u2019t particularly missing or thinking about those boys, either. So I probably hadn\u2019t been feeling the real, true in\u2011love feeling.\n\nStill, I remembered how nice spending time with Terry in California had been. And seeing Mary Anne and Logan together that afternoon really made me want a steady boyfriend of my own. I wasn\u2019t about to settle for just anybody, though. I wanted the perfect boy, one who was everything I dreamed of. I believed he was out there, too. He had to be.\n\nI stretched out on my bed (hugging yourself gets boring very fast) and lay there wondering what my perfect boy would look like. I didn\u2019t care if he was Japanese\u2011American, like I am. He would have to be cute, though. And tall. At least taller than me, and I\u2019m about medium height for my age (which is thirteen).\n\nBesides basic cuteness and tallness, I didn\u2019t have any specific looks requirements. Except muscles. He did have to have some muscles. But not too many muscles. I don\u2019t like those big weight\u2011lifter muscles but I don\u2019t like skinny arms on a guy, either. Something right in the middle would be fine.\n\nTrying to picture this perfect guy made me wonder what exactly I was looking for. After all, if you weren\u2019t sure what you wanted, you might not recognize it when you found it. It would be sort of tragic if Mr. Perfect walked right by me and I didn\u2019t even realize it.\n\nThat\u2019s when I decided I better make a list. A list of all the important qualities I was looking for in Mr. Perfect.\n\nBending upside down, with one hand holding my long black hair up so it wouldn\u2019t touch the floor, I searched under my bed for a pad of paper which I remembered had gotten kicked under there. (Although my room is on the messy side, I usually have a very good idea of where everything is.)\n\nHere\u2019s what I came back up with: a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos; the Nancy Drew book I was reading; and a box of stationery with a red, green, and gold Mexican print border. I couldn\u2019t reach the pad, but that was all right. The Mexican print stationery would do. I was glad to have found these things.\n\nI ripped open the Doritos. I\u2019m just wild about junk food. It\u2019s stashed all over my room. I hide it because my parents don\u2019t approve of my eating junk food. Technically, I suppose they\u2019re right. Junk food is not healthy. But I\u2019m slim and I have good skin \u2014 so what\u2019s the harm?\n\nAs I munched away, I flipped open the Nancy Drew book to the place where I\u2019d left off reading the night before. Just like my junk food, I also have to keep my collection of Nancy Drew books hidden because they\u2019re another thing my parents disapprove of. They don\u2019t think Nancy Drew mysteries are intellectual enough. I don\u2019t understand how they can say that, though. You use your brain plenty when you read a mystery. After all, throughout the book you\u2019re trying to figure out who committed the crime. A good mystery is totally brain\u2011engaging. But Mom and Dad want me to be a scholar like my sixteen\u2011year\u2011old sister, Janine.\n\nJanine is a true\u2011to\u2011life genius who already takes college classes. That\u2019s fine for Janine, but not for me. School just isn\u2019t that interesting to me. I do enough school work to get by, but academics is not my strong point.\n\nAnyway, looking down at my Nancy Drew book reminded me of Nancy\u2019s steady boyfriend, Ned Nickerson. Now Ned is a nearly perfect guy. He\u2019s athletic, smart, nice, and totally devoted to Nancy. He\u2019s always there for her, but he doesn\u2019t get in her way or try to boss her around. He lets Nancy be her own person. Nancy and Ned have a very independent relationship.\n\nMaybe it was too independent. It worked for Nancy since she was always off solving crimes, but I wanted a guy who was around a bit more often than Ned. Come to think of it, Ned didn\u2019t have much sense of humor, either. I was definitely looking for someone who could make me laugh. That was very important.\n\nI put the book aside and took out a piece of stationery. It was time for my list. I started with what I already knew.\n\nChewing the eraser of my pencil, I stopped to think about what else I expected of Mr. Perfect. A few more things came to mind right away, so I wrote them down.\n\nDid I want him to be artistic, like me? I love art of any kind and I\u2019m pretty good at it. (I\u2019m not being conceited, it\u2019s just tr",

          "text": "I, Dawn Schafer, was back in my home state \u2014 the land of beaches and surfing and palm trees and year-round tans. Well, that\u2019s an exaggeration. It\u2019s a stereotyped idea of California. Nevertheless, it was a different life.\n\nDifferent from Stoneybrook, Connecticut, that is. That\u2019s where I live, technically. This trip to California is sort of an extended visit.\n\nConfusing? Not really. I am a child of divorce. My mom lives in Stoneybrook and my dad lives here in Palo City, California. (Once upon a time we all lived in Palo City. I was born here and so was my younger brother, Jeff.)\n\nThe divorce happened when I was in the seventh grade. Mom whisked Jeff and me off to her hometown, Stoneybrook, mainly because her parents \u2014 my Granny and Pop-Pop \u2014 still live there.\n\nI liked Stoneybrook right from the start. We moved into a rambling old farmhouse built in 1795, where I found a secret passageway from the barn to my bedroom! I made some great friends at my new school, and I joined a group called the Baby-sitters Club (I\u2019ll tell you about them later).\n\nAs for Jeff, well, he was miserable. He was rude and difficult at home, and he even started getting into trouble at school. Eventually Mom and Dad agreed he\u2019d be better off back in California. Boy, was it hard to see him go. Our house seemed so empty.\n\nBut not for long. Mom got married again \u2014 to the widowed father of my best friend, Mary Anne Spier. It turned out Mom used to date him in high school. (Isn\u2019t that so romantic?) Mary Anne and her dad moved into our house, and suddenly I had a nice, cozy, new family. My life couldn\u2019t have been better.\n\nExcept when I started thinking about Dad and Jeff.\n\nAnd thinking. And thinking.\n\nAnd missing them more and more.\n\nImagine if your dad and your only brother lived three thousand miles away. Let me tell you, it feels awful. I\u2019d visited them a couple of times, but that just wasn\u2019t enough. I felt as if they were in another world, floating away from me. I needed to spend some time out West. A lot of time.\n\nMary Anne cried when I told her how I was feeling, but she understood. Poor Mom \u2014 she took it personally at first. When she phoned Dad about it, they argued. But that didn\u2019t stop them from exploring my idea. They had to consult guidance counselors at Stoneybrook Middle School and at Vista, my California school, to make sure I wouldn\u2019t screw up my education if I moved. Then, finally, they agreed I could live with Dad for six months or so.\n\nWhich is how I became bicoastal. (I love that word. It sounds so glamorous.)\n\nTo be honest, it isn\u2019t very glamorous at all, but you know what? Coming out here was definitely the right thing to do. That aching feeling is gone. It\u2019s fun to be around Dad, and I no longer miss Jeff (honestly, I want to throttle him sometimes).",

          "text": "\"Hey, Dawn!\" a voice called from behind me.\n\nI turned. Our school is actually a bunch of small buildings grouped around a courtyard filled with flowering bushes and juniper trees. Walking across the courtyard were two of my best California friends, Sunny Winslow and Maggie Blume. Sunny was holding out an open bag of vegetable chips.\n\n\"Hi!\" I called back.\n\n\"Want some?\" Sunny asked.\n\n\"Sure!\" Yum. Vegetable chips are the best. They\u2019re like potato chips, except they\u2019re made with carrots and parsnips and sweet potatoes and other great stuff.\n\nOkay, stop gagging. I just happen to like natural foods. Vegetable chips are the best. They\u2019re like potato chips, except they\u2019re made with carrots and parsnips and sweet potatoes and other great stuff.\n\nHaving best friends on both coasts is pretty fantastic. Not to mention belonging to two great baby-sitting clubs.\n\nThat\u2019s right. I am a bicoastal baby-sitter. Here in Palo City, I belong to the We \u2665 Kids Club (pronounced \u201cWe Love Kids Club\u201d). Sunny started the club while I was living in Stoneybrook, after I\u2019d told her about the BSC.\n\nMaggie\u2019s a member of the club, too, along with one other girl, Jill Henderson. (Jill lives pretty far from school, so she takes a bus home.) All four of us have blonde hair. Actually, my hair is the lightest (it\u2019s almost white). I suppose we could call ourselves the BSC, too, for \u201cBlonde Sitters Club.\u201d\n\nOr maybe OFEC, for \u201cOrganic Food Eaters Club.\u201d Sunny, Maggie, and I tore into those chips on our stroll down Palm Boulevard.",

The sun beamed down and the air was full of familiar southern California scents: flowers, salt air, and car exhaust. (Oh, well, I guess no place is perfect.)\n\n\"You guys want to have a meeting today?\" Sunny asked.\n\nMaggie nodded. \"We haven\u2019t had one in a week.\"\n\n\"I can\u2019t make it,\" I said. \"I have to sit for Stephie. How about tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Sounds cool to me,\" Maggie replied.\n\n\"I\u2019ll call Jill,\" Sunny offered.\n\nPretty casual, huh? That\u2019s the We \u2665 Kids Club \u2014 no rules, no regularly scheduled meetings. Much different from the BSC. If Kristy Thomas, the BSC founder, had heard that conversation, she would have had a heart attack. She\u2019s a real rules freak. The Baby-sitters Club is run like a business, with strict meeting times, officers, and record\u2011keeping. I have to admit, at first I had trouble getting used to the easy\u2011going W\u2665KC style. Now I find it kind of refreshing.\n\nAnyway, we yacked and munched for about ten more minutes, until we reached Stephie Robertson\u2019s house. I said good\u2011bye to my friends and rang the bell.\n\n\"Dawn! Dawn! Da",

          "text": "The Baby\u2011sitters Club, or BSC for short, is one of the most important things in my life. You see, I\u2019m the secretary and one of the original members. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. First I should tell you who I am. Then I\u2019ll tell you about the club.\n\nMy name\u2019s Mary Anne Spier. I\u2019m thirteen and in the eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. I have brown eyes, short dark hair, and I\u2019m pretty short myself. Most people say I am very sensitive, and I guess they\u2019re right. Usually, I don\u2019t mind being sensitive. I think it makes me understanding of other people. My friends know that when they have problems, I\u2019ll listen and be sympathetic. The bad part is, I cry at the least little thing. (I still get weepy over Pollyanna, and I bet I\u2019ve seen that movie at least twenty times.)\n\nMy mother died when I was really little, so my father had to raise me by himself. He had an awful lot of rules for me. For example, I had to wear little girl jumpers and dresses, and keep my hair in braids (to make the six\u2011year\u2011old look complete). I know he meant well, but it was terribly frustrating.\n\nLuckily, that has changed, partly because I convinced him I was growing up, and partly because he got married again (more about that later). Now I can dress however I like \u2014 within reason. And I can wear clip\u2011on earrings, which I think look pretty good.\n\nDad and I used to live on Bradford Court, next door to Kristy Thomas, my first best friend. It was Kristy\u2019s idea to form the Baby\u2011sitters Club. Besides being a great idea, it was also a big help to me. I\u2019m not only sensitive, I\u2019m shy, which makes it kind of difficult to meet new people. Thanks to the BSC, I made seven more close friends, including one boyfriend, Logan Bruno.\n\nWhat can I say about Logan? He\u2019s smart and funny, is incredibly cute, and has this charming Southern accent. (That\u2019s because he\u2019s from Kentucky.) When Logan first moved to Stoneybrook, a lot of girls at SMS thought he was cute, but he picked me to be his girlfriend. That was one of the biggest surprises of my life. How did it happen? Over baby\u2011sitting, of course. First, Logan volunteered to join the BSC. Then we baby\u2011sat for the Rodowskys together. After that Logan asked me to go to the Remember September dance. Then one thing led to another and pretty soon we were going steady. We\u2019ve gone through some rough spots, and we even broke up once, because Logan was getting a little too possessive. But he agreed to give me more space, and lately our relationship has been great.\n\nWould you believe me if I told you that I not only met my boyfriend through the BSC, but my sister, too? Well, it\u2019s true. Growing up with just my dad, I always dreamed of having a sister. Of course, I knew it could never happen. Then I met Dawn Schafer, who had just moved to Connecticut with her mom and her younger brother, Jeff. Dawn joined the BSC and became my other best friend. We didn\u2019t know it when we met, but her mom and my father had been high school sweethearts. We found that out while looking through some old high school yearbooks that belonged to Dawn\u2019s mom, and we decided it would be fun for our parents to meet up again, so we arranged it. And guess what? They fell in love all over again. Before long they were married, and my dream had come true. I had a sister. (Dawn is really my stepsister, of course, but she feels like a genuine sister.)\n\nAfter the wedding, Dad and I left Bradford Court and moved in with Dawn and Sharon. (Dawn\u2019s brother, Jeff, had decided he was much happier living with his dad in California.) Now we all live in an old farmhouse that was built in the seventeen\u2011hundreds. It even has a secret passage which we think may be haunted!\n\nThings were a little bumpy at first, because we have such different habits. My dad is Mister Organization. He categorizes everything \u2014 including his clothes \u2014 and he likes to keep things neat as a pin. Sharon is the opposite. She\u2019s really absentminded and does the craziest things, such as leaving her high\u2011heels in the vegetable drawer of the refrigerator, or putting the pruning shears in the bathroom cabinet. Another big difference between our two families is that Sharon and Dawn (and Jeff) are practically vegetarians. They don\u2019t eat red meat, and they actually like tofu burgers and brown rice, whereas Dad and I prefer normal food, such as steak and french fries.\n\nStill, despite our differences, we were getting along fine until last fall, when Dawn decided that she really missed her father and brother. After a good deal of soul\u2011searching she asked Sharon and her dad if she could spend some time in California. It was a difficult decision for both parents, but in the end they agreed that Dawn could go. I think I understand why Dawn wanted to leave, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from missing her like c",

          "text": "How is a school bus like a person with the flu? Well, they both groan, lurch, cough, wheeze, and heave.\n\nGross, right? But if you\u2019ve ever really thought about it, it\u2019s true. I mean, if you\u2019ve ever spent any time on a school bus.\n\nI have \u2014 many, many mornings and afternoons, going to and from Stoneybrook Middle School. I like SMS, don\u2019t get me wrong and riding the bus can be, well, interesting. But all the same, that old bus has a lot in common with the symptoms of the flu.\n\nStill, when I\u2019m riding the SMS bus, I can sometimes get some important thinking done. That might sound kind of weird, I know. I mean, school buses, especially after school, are going to be right on the edge of absolute chaos, right? But it takes a lot of chaos to equal the level of activity at my house when it gets going. What\u2019s one school bus full of kids compared to a house with two parents, one grandmother, five full\u2011time resident kids, two weekend\u2011and\u2011holiday kids, a dog, a cat, two goldfish, and a resident ghost?\n\nNot that I\u2019m complaining! I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. But it does make the bus seem sort of peaceful sometimes.\n\nI guess I\u2019d better introduce myself. I\u2019m Kristy. Kristy Thomas. I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where I\u2019m in the eighth grade at SMS. My mother and father were divorced when I was about eight and my father sort of disappeared from our lives, although we get occasional random cards and phone calls from him in California, where he lives now.\n\nSo that left my mom, my older brother Charlie, who\u2019s four years older than me, my other older brother Sam, who\u2019s two years older, me, and my little brother David Michael, who was just a baby. (He\u2019s seven now.) We lived next door to my best friend Mary Anne Spier and across the street from another good friend, Claudia Kishi (more about them later).\n\nThen, not too long ago, my mom met Watson Brewer and they fell in love and got married. Pretty amazing. Even more amazing was moving to Watson\u2019s house \u2014 only it\u2019s not a house, it\u2019s a mansion, because Watson is a real, live millionaire. Which means that we went from living in a small house (David Michael\u2019s room wasn\u2019t much bigger than a closet) to a house where we all have our own rooms (which are definitely not closets). We also went up a couple of sizes as a family, from my brothers and mom and me to us and Watson and Karen Brewer, Andrew Brewer, Emily Michelle, Nannie, and the ghost of Ben Brewer.\n\nAndrew and Karen are Watson\u2019s two children from his first marriage. Karen, who\u2019s seven, has a world\u2011class imagination, and Andrew, who\u2019s four, can be world\u2011class shy. They spend every other weekend and a lot of holidays with us.\n\nEmily Michelle is our newest family member. We adopted her. She\u2019s Vietnamese. She\u2019s two and a half and so cute. She\u2019s just learning to talk, something she\u2019s not overly enthusiastic about. But she manages to make herself understood, with or without words, that\u2019s for sure!\n\nThat\u2019s where Nannie comes in. She\u2019s our maternal grandmother, and when Emily Michelle arrived, Nannie agreed to come live with us to help look after Emily Michelle and all the rest of us. Nannie drives a pink car we call the Pink Clinker (you can sort of tell how it works by its name \u2014 a near relative of the school bus, maybe), is a member of a bowling league, and, like Watson, is an avid gardener. Needless to say, we all think she is pretty cool.\n\nShannon and Boo\u2011Boo are the quadrupeds. (Vocabulary words do come in handy sometimes. Quadruped means four\u2011legged.) Shannon is a Bernese mountain dog puppy we got a little while after our wonderful old collie, Louie, died. We miss Louie still, but Shannon is very much a member of the family \u2014 with a dog imagination to equal Karen\u2019s human one, a little stubbornness like Emily Michelle, and enough puppy energy to keep us all busy.\n\nBoo\u2011Boo, on the other hand, does not, I think, have any family traits. Boo\u2011Boo is a big, fat, mean old gray cat with yellow eyes. He has a short temper and will bite and scratch if provoked. What constitutes provocation is a mystery to all of us. Sometimes just walking by him is enough to earn you a swat on the ankle!\n\nHave I forgotten anybody?\n\nOh, yeah, the goldfish, and Ben Brewer, the ghost of Watson\u2019s great\u2011great\u2011grandfather. Okay, okay, maybe a ghost really doesn\u2019t live on the third floor. But Karen (who else?) believes it, and she can be pretty convincing. Ben really does have his own room, too, a bedroom with all his old stuff in it including his rocking chair. And sometimes, Karen has even me believing that Ben Brewer\u2019s chair is still rocking, a little, when we visit his room.\n\nSo that\u2019s our household. It\u2019s never, ever dull, and if it sounds chaotic, well, mostly I love it. And who knows? Maybe it\u2019s one of the reasons I am so assertive and organized.\n\nAnd maybe it\u2019s my unique organizational skills and training that enable me to use my time on the bus efficiently \u2014 like thinking about the Baby\u2011sitters Club (I\u2019m the president, and more about that later, too) and about the Krushers, the, well, unique softball team that I coach.\n\nWhich is what I was thinking about when the bus pulled up to my stop.",

          "text": "\u201cGirl, what are you doing?\u201d\n\nUh-oh. I had thought I was alone in the hallway. Instead I was caught red-handed by a classmate of mine, Sanjita Batts. Actually, red-toed was more like it. I confess, I was walking to my Short Takes class en pointe.\n\nThat is ballet terminology for \u201con the tips of your toes.\u201d And I mean the very tips. It\u2019s hard to do, especially for a sixth-grader like me.\n\nWalking en pointe looks beautiful on stage. But in the hallway of Stoneybrook Middle School, it looks \u2026 well, dumb.\n\nSo why was I doing it? Because I, Jessica Ramsey, am a dance fanatic. I love ballet and I want to be a professional dancer someday. Even if it means having mangled toes the rest of my life. (Have you ever seen a ballerina\u2019s feet? They\u2019re frightening.)\n\n\u201cJust practicing,\u201d I said, lowering myself to a normal walking position.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d Sanji had a mischievous glint in her eye. \u201cYou should walk into class like that!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way!\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cSeriously! Can you imagine the look on Mr. Trout\u2019s face?\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t help giggling. We have a new Short Takes teacher every term, and our latest one, Mr. Trout, was kind of a nerd.\n\nEvery student at Stoneybrook Middle School has Short Takes for one period a day. It\u2019s a special program of revolving courses. No, the room does not turn in a slow circle like one of those fancy hotel restaurants. What I mean is, every grading period we get a new subject and a new teacher. What kind of subjects? Unusual ones, like Stress Reduction for Teens; or Project Work, in which we all had to take after-school jobs in the community (I worked in a movie theater).\n\nOur current class was called Software from Scratch, which was really another way of saying Computer Programming.\n\nComputer programs are a little like dances. On the outside they both look fun and easy. But behind every graceful ballet is a lot of sweating and grunting and muscle strain and step-by-step memorizing. And behind every cool graphics program is a million or so lines of gobbledygook.\n\nThat\u2019s what our Short Takes class was about. Creating the gobbledygook.\n\nYawn. Give me an hour a day of dance warmups anytime.\n\nAs Sanjita and I headed to class, we heard the loud clattering of high heels from around the corner ahead of us.\n\n\u201cQuick,\u201d Sanji whispered. \u201cDolly One or Two?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm \u2026 Two,\u201d I said.\n\nI was wrong. Ms. Bernhardt, otherwise known as Dolly One, bounced around the corner toward us. Her thick blonde hair looked as if it were doing jumping jacks on her head.\n\nDolly Two is another teacher, Ms. Vandela. The two Dollies, as you can guess, look alike. They\u2019re short and big-chested. They both have huge smiles and Major Hair that cascades in ringlets over their shoulders. They also wear tons of makeup. You\u2019ve probably already figured out how they got their nicknames. Right. They\u2019re both Dolly Parton clones \u2014 and Dolly Parton fans, so they don\u2019t mind their nicknames at all. (In case you don\u2019t know, Dolly Parton is a famous country-western singer who fits the above description.)\n\n\u201cHi, girls!\u201d Dolly One chirped as she bustled by with a clipboard. \u201cI\u2019m posting sign-up sheets for the Follies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlready?\u201d Sanji asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s springtime, darling,\u201d Dolly One replied. \u201cNow, I want both of you to think about signing up. We want to get a good cross section of the school!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Sanji said.\n\nI should explain something. Sanjita is Puerto Rican and I am African-American. Stoneybrook is a mostly white town. What Dolly One meant by cross section was \u201cnot only white students.\u201d\n\nNow, I knew she was only trying to be fair. She\u2019s a nice person, and she wanted to make sure Sanji and I didn\u2019t feel excluded. But statements like that make me feel funny. They remind me how different I am in some people\u2019s eyes.\n\nI didn\u2019t always feel so different. In Oakley, New Jersey, where I grew up, people of all colors lived together and no one made a big deal about it. But when my family moved to Stoneybrook before sixth grade started, boy, were we in for a shock. Some people were really cold to us, as if we didn\u2019t belong. Others seemed afraid to be near us. Kids acted hostile to me in school. It was awful for awhile. Fortunately, things have improved a lot since then. Stoneybrook has turned out to be a great place, and I made a bunch of the best friends in the world when I joined the Baby-sitters Club (which I\u2019ll tell you about later).\n\nAnyway, I was dying to find out about the show. As Ms. Bernhardt clickety-clacked down the hallway, I asked Sanjita, \u201cWhat are the Follies?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, the Sixth-Grade Follies?\u201d Sanji said. \u201cWhere the sixth-graders make up songs and skits and stuff? SMS has one every year.\u201d\n\nI shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t live here last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s sooo hilarious. My big sister was in last year\u2019s. The students write the whole show. You get to do imitations and make fun of teachers, students, the school \u2014 everything.\u201d Then she laughed and added, \u201cProbably even walk on your toes, if you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you going to sign up?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo way. I get stage fright. You?\u201d\n\n\u201cI might.\u201d\n\nMight? Whoa. An end-of-the-year show, all original stuff \u2014 it sounded perfect. I love to make people laugh. I was the comedy highlight of a school production of Peter Pan (well, I was). And with my dance experience, maybe I\u2019d be able to choreograph and perform.\n\nI was flying high as we walked into our Short Takes class.\n\nMr. Trout was scribbling something on the blackboard. His eyes darted toward Sanji and me.\n\n\u201cHello, Mr. Trout,\u201d Sanji said in a voice that was so friendly it sounded phony.\n\nHe looked back at the board, adjusted his glasses, and grunted a soft \u201cHi.\u201d\n\nSanji glanced at me, rolled her eyes, and giggled. We both sat down as the bell rang.\n\nTo my right, John Rosen and Mark O\u2019Connell were playing tic-tac-toe, passing a sheet of paper back and forth. To my left, Sandra Hart was reading a comic book. A spitball flew across the room and landed in Renee Johnson\u2019s hair. Two boys burst out laughing.\n\n\u201cEwww!\u201d Renee shouted. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting! Mr. T",

Just the word California says it all.\n\nDo I sound as if I like living here? I do. Maybe it\u2019s no coincidence, either, that my father\u2019s nickname for me is Sunshine. Or that one of my two best friends in California is named Sunny.\n\nAnd summer in California is California to the max. Surf\u2019s up. Minimum clothing dress code. Sunscreen and shades and \u2026 well, you get the idea.\n\nDawn Schafer (that\u2019s me) of Stoneybrook, Connecticut and Palo City, California, was about to settle in for a smooooth summer in the redundantly sunny California sun. (Oh, okay, California isn\u2019t always sunny and warm, but it feels that way to me.)\n\nI guess I do sound a little like a tourist, the ones you see on the beaches sometimes with cameras and big flowered shirts and weird sunglasses, snapping pictures of everything that moves. But I was actually born and raised in California. I never truly appreciated it, though, until my mother and father got divorced and my mom moved back to her hometown, Stoneybrook, Connecticut, with me and my younger brother, Jeff. That\u2019s where her parents, our grandparents, Granny and Pop-Pop, still live.",

          "text": "Naturally I was not enthusiastic about the move. But we bought this old farmhouse built back in the 1700s and I actually discovered a secret passageway from my bedroom to the barn. Then I made friends with Mary Anne Spier and she invited me to join a group called the Baby-sitters Club (or the BSC) and soon I was pretty happy.\n\nNot my brother Jeff, though. He went from obnoxious-but-lovable little brother to monster brother and he even started getting in trouble at school. He wanted to go back to California and eventually, Mom and Dad decided that it might be best.\n\nI hated to see Jeff go. In such a short time we\u2019d gone from being a family of four in one place, to a bicoastal divorced family, two here, two there.\n\nBut not for long. Mary Anne\u2019s father and my mother rediscovered each other. They\u2019d known each other in high school and dated and then lost touch. But the romance rekindled and they got married. (Mary Anne\u2019s mother had died when she was just a baby and she and her father had been a family of two for practically her whole life.) So anyway, Mary Anne and her father moved into the farmhouse along with Mary Anne\u2019s gray tiger kitten Tigger. Since Mary Anne and I were already best friends, things couldn\u2019t get any better than that, right?",

My father and my brother were a different story, though. I finally decided I had to go west again for more than a visit.\n\nIt was a hard decision. It made Mary Anne cry (which made me cry, too), and it made Mom pretty miserable, especially since she took it personally. But eventually she and Dad worked it out (along with the guidance counselors at Stoneybrook Middle School and at Vista, my California school, who had to make sure I would have \u201ccontinuity of education\u201d if I moved back to California for any length of time).

I mean our father. You see, he\u2019s been dating a lot lately. Especially since he broke his engagement with Carol, this woman he\u2019d been seeing for a long time.

Worse than being the new kid in school by about a hundred times.\n\nBut anyway, that\u2019s over and Dad is doing what Granny calls \u201cplaying the field.\u201d That means he\u2019s dating a lot. And a lot of different kinds of people.\n\nIt also means that after the first couple of dates, the \u201cdate me, date my kids\u201d theme goes into effect. That means that on the next date, Dad includes Jeff and me.\n\nTry to imagine going on a date \u2014 which includes your parents.

That\u2019s the feeling I had when I opened my eyes on Monday morning.\n\n\u201cClaudia!\u201d Mom called from downstairs. \u201cAre you up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up,\u201d I mumbled, not moving.\n\n\u201cBetter hurry. You don\u2019t want to be late for school.\u201d\n\nWant to bet?\n\nI lay on my back staring at the ceiling, where I had painted little stars and moons the week before. As an artist, I have this theory: if you can\u2019t eat it or wear it \u2014 paint it. That\u2019s what helped me decide to use the walls and ceiling of my room as my canvas. I also paint clothes (I tie\u2011dy them, too) and shoes. I have several pairs of high\u2011top sneakers that I decorated in glitter and puff paint. I even have a pair of ballet flats that are entirely covered in red sequins. I call them my ruby slippers, after Dorothy's in The Wizard of Oz.\n\nAnyway, I was staring at the purple polka dot cow I'd painted jumping over a silver moon, and I got that tingly feeling again. It was definitely not my usual Monday morning feeling.\n\nI\u2019m generally grumpy at the start of the week. I think most kids feel pretty cranky on Monday mornings, except those few mutant types who leap out of bed at the crack of dawn and can\u2019t wait to hurry to school and take a test so they can add yet another A to their straight A record. (Have you guessed that I\u2019m not exactly your model student?)\n\nSchool is okay. There are even one or two classes I really enjoy, like art. But there are some classes, like English \u2014 particularly spelling \u2014 that practically paralyze me. I don\u2019t know why that is. Neither do my parents. They think I don\u2019t apply myself and that I need to study harder. They may be right. Let\u2019s face it, I don\u2019t spend every single night slaving over my homework. I have a well\u2011rounded life, unlike my sister Janine, who\u2019s a junior in high school but also takes college classes. Can you believe it? No wonder my parents are disappointed in my grades. But it\u2019s really hard to complete with a total genius.\n\nAnyway, back to my tingly feeling. What could possibly be causing it? Nothing special was scheduled at school.",

Kristy Thomas (our club president) had talked the week before about wanting to start a fall project. Along with the baby\u2011sitting, the Baby\u2011Sitters Club organizes lots of fun activities, like neighborhood carnivals and talent shows. Once we even had an ecology fair and got our whole school involved in recycling and conservation. But maybe I should tell you more about myself, and then fill you in on the Baby\u2011Sitters Club.\n\nMy full name is Claudia Lynn Kishi, but sometimes my friends call me Claud. I\u2019m thirteen and I\u2019m in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. I'm a huge part of the school's vibe, so you wouldn't think I'd be shy about my interests. I'm also a budding artist who doesn't let the school environment stifle my creative projects. I can talk about paint, my rubber boots, and my unique footwear (like the ruby slippers I painted) as easily as I can talk about the homework struggles I mention earlier. I always try to weave my creative side into every part of my life.\n\nClaudia, you have exactly five minutes to get dressed and eat breakfast,\u201d Mom called from downstairs. \u201cAre you up?\u201d\n\n\u201c I'm up.\u201d\n\nClaudia, you have exactly five minutes to get dressed and eat breakfast, Mom called from downstairs. \u201cI'm about to go back to school. I have to start making my way to the front door.\n\nBe sure to come straight home,\u201d Stacey called. \u201cYou\u2019ll be receiving a very important phone call around four o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\nPick up the pace, Claud,\u201d Stacey called.\n\nI would have stayed longer, pleading for just a little clue, but I spied my best friend, Stacey McGill, standing at the end of my walk.",

          "text": "I woke up with a mouthful of cat fur.\n\n\"Rrrrrrrrr,\" purred my kitten, Tigger, as he shifted position on my chest.\n\n\"Morning, Tiggy,\" I mumbled.\n\nThe dream had faded. I was Mary Anne Spier again, not Belle. And I was in my normal old bedroom in my normal old house in normal old Stoneybrook, Connecticut.\n\nSigh. Tiggy had made me miss my happy ending.\n\nI yawned, rubbed my eyes, and looked at my alarm clock. It was twenty minutes before wake-up time. I thought about going back to sleep. Maybe my dream was on pause, like a videotape, and I could pick up that happy ending (I love happy endings).\n\nInstead, I gently pushed Tigger aside and sat up. Glancing out my window, I broke into a big smile. I could not wait to start the day.\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t a holiday or my birthday or the first snow of the year. School was not canceled. The trees had not sprouted dollar bills. It was just an ordinary Monday morning in October.\n\nWell, ordinary except for a few things: I was caught up with my homework, not one person was mad at me, my boyfriend and I were getting along great, my family was happy, and the Baby\u2011sitters Club was not overwhelmed with work. (I will tell you more about the Baby\u2011sitters Club \u2014 or BSC \u2014 later.)\n\nOh, and the weather was gorgeous. The leaves were just starting to turn colors, but it was still warm enough to wear a light jacket outside.\n\nEverything was just \u2026 right.\n\nNot that my life is usually so awful. It\u2019s not. Okay, I admit, I tend to be a worrywart. My friends tease me for being so sensitive. I\u2019m practically famous for crying at movies. (My boyfriend, Logan Bruno, says he\u2019s going to bring a squeegee on our next date.)\n\nBut on that October morning, I wasn\u2019t worried about a thing. I got out of bed and practically skipped to my closet. I had picked out my clothes the night before: a brand\u2011new pair of rust\u2011colored corduroy slacks, a blue button\u2011down shirt, and a floral\u2011patterned white cotton sweater.\n\nThat\u2019s my look \u2014 Neat Preppy Casual \u2014 and I love it. Especially compared to my old look, which was more like Elementary School Blah. Up until seventh grade, my dad insisted I wear little\u2011girl clothes and keep my hair in pigtails. That was back when he and I lived alone in a small house on Bradford Court. You see, when I was a baby, my mom died. My grandparents agreed to take me for a while because Dad was so upset \u2014 and they didn\u2019t want to give me back when Dad said he was ready. They finally did, but Dad became convinced he had to be a perfect parent, to make up for Mom. To him, that meant being super\u2011strict.\n\nNow I\u2019m in eighth grade; I have a cool, short haircut; I live in a rambling old farmhouse with Dad and a stepfamily I adore.\n\nWhat happened? For one thing, Dad began realizing I was growing up. Then his life changed dramatically. How? Well, it\u2019s only the most romantic story of the century! A modern\u2011day Beauty and the Beast (but don\u2019t you dare tell my dad I said that). I mean, there he was, lonely and single (and strict). Then one day a girl named Dawn Schafer moved into town with her divorced mother. I became Dawn\u2019s friend, and we discovered that her mom was the former high\u2011school sweetheart of guess who? Yes, Lonely and Single Richard Spier. So Dawn and I got them together \u2026 and it was love at first sight. (Second sight?) Anyway, they married, Dad and I moved in with the Schafers, I got a fabulous stepsister, and everybody lived happily ever after.\n\nWell, that\u2019s not totally true. The story has an epilogue, which happens to be the one slightly negative thing about my life. Dawn is in California, living with her dad and brother for a few months. And boy, do I miss her.\n\nBut even that isn\u2019t so bad. We talk on the phone a lot, and she is coming back.\n\nDawn was born and raised in California. She is pretty and very warm\u2011hearted. Her face is freckled, and she has light\u2011blonde hair almost down to her waist. Our personalities are quite different. Dawn\u2019s a real individualist who doesn\u2019t mind making waves. She\u2019s a health\u2011food addict, she believes in animal rights and environmental causes, and she doesn\u2019t mind a bit if people tease her about her beliefs.\n\nNow that she\u2019s gone, I must admit I don\u2019t feel quite so guilty when I eat red meat and junk food. But even so, I can\u2019t wait till she gets back!",

When Alice hears what they\u2019ve done she goes wild trying to get the closet door open. She succeeds in setting the actress free, but accidentally knocks over the man who plays the back half of the mule. Alice is the only one who can fit the mule costume, so she takes his part, and makes her brother Sven put on the maid\u2019s costume and take her small part. Sven keeps forgetting the lines, so Alice whispers them to him from the back of the mule outfit, which makes everyone in the audience laugh.\n\nCrazy things like that are always happening to Alice. But the cool thing about the book is the way her family sticks together. No matter what happens, Mrs. Anderson, the mother, always manages to make a big dinner and the family sits around laughing about whatever it was that went wrong.",

How could she think of so many funny things to write? Her characters were so happy and full of fun. Just reading the book gave me a great feeling.\n\nWhen I reached the last pages, my eyes brimmed with tears. Nothing sad had happened. I was just touched by how Alice\u2019s brothers saved all their money to buy her a train ticket to Hollywood. And then Alice cashed it in so their youngest brother, Evan, could have an emergency operation. (He\u2019d fallen through a weak spot in the ice while ice fishing to earn money for Alice\u2019s ticket.) In the end, Evan was all right, and the family sat around the big dinner table laughing and having a good time.\n\nMaybe tears filled my eyes because the book was over. I hate when a good book ends.\n\nOne way I judge whether or not a book is great is if I feel I know the author when I\u2019m done reading. If I do, then it was a great book! I definitely felt that I knew Henrietta Hayes. It was as if we were friends.

Kristy told her idea to her best friend, Mary Anne Spier. Then they told their friend Claudia. Claudia told her new friend Stacey McGill, and the BSC was born. They put up some fliers around Stoneybrook and, almost instantly, the club was successful.\n\nBusiness grew so much that they added another member, Dawn Schafer, who had recently moved to Stoneybrook from California. Five sitters worked fine, but after awhile Stacey had to move away. (Although she eventually came back, at the time we thought Stacey was gone forever.) That\u2019s when Jessi and I were invited to join. We\u2019re junior officers since we\u2019re eleven and the others are all thirteen. We baby-sit only on weekends or during afternoons (unless we\u2019re sitting for our own siblings), but that frees other members to take more evening jobs, so it works out well.\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve had another staff switch. Dawn went back to California to stay for a while with her father and brother. (Her parents are divorced.) In her absence, Shannon Kilbourne is filling in. Before Dawn left, Shannon was an associate member, which meant she didn\u2019t come to meetings regularly. Instead, we\u2019d call her up when we needed her to take sitting jobs no one else was free for. Now, she attends meetings.\n\nLet me tell you about the members of the club. I\u2019ll start with Jessi, since you already know a little about her. As I\u2019ve said, she\u2019s a talented ballerina and my very best friend. Like me, she loves to read, especially books about horses. Unlike me, she doesn\u2019t have a huge family. Her family consists of her mother, father, her younger sister Becca, and her little brother Squirt (his real name is John Philip Ramsey, Jr.). Jessi\u2019s Aunt Cecelia lives with them, too.

          "text": "RRREEOWW!\\n\\nI sat bolt upright in my bed. This was not an ordinary Saturday morning. Something very strange was happening outside. It sounded as if a cat had gotten its tail caught in some door.\\n\\nI stumbled to my bedroom window and peered outside. The world had been painted white.\\n\\n\u201cSnow!\u201d I gasped. \u201cWhen did that happen?\u201d\\n\\nSnow\u2019s not unusual for winter in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, but the day before had been warm and sunny. A blizzard must have hit us while I was asleep.\\n\\nRRREEOW!\\n\\nThe high\u2011pitched whine was coming from the spinning wheels of my stepfather\u2019s car. It was stuck fast in a two\u2011foot drift that lined our driveway. Watson Brewer, dressed in a wool topcoat and hat, was trying to push the car out of the drift. I could tell he was putting a lot of effort into it because his face was bright red.\\n\\nWho was driving? I rubbed my hand in a circle to defog my window. My seventeen\u2011year\u2011old brother, Charlie, sat behind the wheel of the car, revving the engine, while bits of dirt and snow sprayed all over the place.\\n\\nI chuckled to myself. \u201cEven when you live in a mansion, your car can get stuck.\u201d\\n\\nYou see, I haven\u2019t always lived in a mansion. I used to live in a little house on Bradford Court with my mom and three brothers: Charlie (the one at the wheel), Sam, age fifteen, and David Michael, age seven and a half. Who am I? Kristy Thomas. I\u2019m thirteen and in the eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. When I was little, my dad walked out on my family, leaving Mom to work and raise four kids by herself. It was a struggle, but Mom\u2019s pretty tough, and my brothers and I tried to help out as much as we could.\\n\\nI loved living on Bradford Court because my best friend, Mary Anne Spier, was my next\u2011door neighbor. And Claudia Kishi, another terrific friend, lived right across the street. If we hadn\u2019t all been neighbors, the Baby\u2011sitters Club probably wouldn\u2019t even exist. What\u2019s the Baby\u2011sitters Club? Just one of the most important things in my life, that\u2019s all. But I\u2019ll tell you all about the BSC later.\\n\\nWhere was I? Oh, yeah. While we were living on Bradford Court, Mom met Watson Brewer, a genuine millionaire. I\u2019m not kidding. He is the CEO (Chief Executive Officer) of Unity Insurance, which has its main offices in Stamford. Anyway, after Mom and Watson dated for a while, they fell in love. Before we knew it they were married, and Mom and us four kids joined Watson and his two kids who live with him every other month, four\u2011year\u2011old Andrew and seven\u2011year\u2011old Karen, in the mansion on McLelland Street.\\n\\nKaren and Andrew are terrific. Karen is bright (she has already skipped a grade in school), reads like crazy, and has a tremendous imagination. She makes up great ghost stories and almost convinced me that our next\u2011door neighbor, Mrs. Porter, is a witch named Morbidda Destiny.\\n\\nWhile Karen is outgoing, Andrew can be pretty shy. And though he\u2019s not athletic as I am, he tries hard. During our Mini\u2011Olympics he entered every event and won the \u201cMost Determined\u201d award.\\n\\nAfter Mom and Watson got married, they adopted two\u2011year\u2011old Emily Michelle from Vietnam. Soon after that, my grandmother, Nannie, moved in too, to help out. So when Andrew and Karen are here ten people live in our house. Ten people, plus the Brewer/Thomas zoo. Boo\u2011Boo, Watson\u2019s extremely large cat, who is practically as big as a person. And Shannon the Bernese mountain dog puppy, who thinks she\u2019s a person. Finally, our two goldfish, Crystal Light the Second and Goldfishie, and two pets that travel back and forth with Karen and Andrew, a rat named Emily Junior, and a hermit crab named Bob.",

I threw on a turtleneck, a sweater, and jeans (my friends in the BSC call it my uniform) and hurried downstairs to see what I could do to help out.\\n\\nEmily Michelle was parked in front of the television in the den, watching cartoons and munching dry Cocoa Puffs out of a bowl. Since she\u2019s only two and a half, most of them were spilling onto the carpet. I made a mental note to be sure to clean them up later.\\n\\nNannie was in the dining room, listening to one of her favorite CDs while she dusted. It was Frank Sinatra, working up to the big finale to \u201cNew York, New York.\u201d I caught Nannie waving her dust rag in the air, doing high kicks in time to the music.\\n\\nCan you tell she\u2019s not your average grandmother\u2011type? She\u2019s a bowler extraordinaire, a green\u2011thumbed gardener, one fantastic chef, and the owner of possibly the most outrageous car in Stoneybrook \u2014 the Pink Clinker. I\u2019m nuts about her. And so\u2019s everyone else. Her list of friends is very long and includes the grocers, folks from her old neighborhood, and practically everyone she\u2019s helped as a volunteer at the hospital.\\n\\nMy brother Sam was in the mudroom, putting on his coat and gloves, getting ready to head off to his part\u2011time job at the grocery store.\\n\\n\u201cCock\u2011a\u2011doodle\u2011doo!

The director said so.\u201d\\n\\nDavid Michael has been bitten by the acting bug. And he\u2019s got it bad. Ever since he played a Winkie in his school production of The Wizard of Oz, all he ever talks about is the theatre. When our community theatre announced they were doing The Brementown Musicians as their winter children\u2019s show, he begged to be allowed to audition. He was cast as the rooster, and all we\u2019ve heard for the past week is, \u201cCock\u2011a\u2011doodle\u2011doo! I\u2019m a musician, too!\u201d It\u2019s enough to drive anyone batty.\\n\\n\u201cLook, David Michael, if the director wants you to be more friendly, why don\u2019t you try smiling when you say your line?\u201d I suggested. \u201cYou could even do a friendly l",

She rubbed one mittened hand across the front of her glasses.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s so beautiful. And think of all the great ballets with snow in them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish my glasses had little windshield wipers,\u201d answered Mallory. \u201cThen I might agree with you.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhat ballets?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2026 well, The Nutcracker, for one.\u201d I did a sort of pirouette on the sidewalk \u2014 and slipped.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d said Mallory, catching my arm. We laughed. Then she added, \u201cIt is pretty. I just wish it would stick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s cold enough,\u201d I said with regret.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m officially complaining here. If it is going to be winter, it should act like winter. It should snow and stick.\u201d\n\nIn case you just pirouetted into the middle of all this (if you know what I mean), I should explain.\n\nI\u2019m Jessi. Jessi Ramsey. I\u2019m in sixth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School, also known as SMS, in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. Mallory Pike is my best friend, and also a fellow member of the Baby\u2011sitters Club (also known as the BSC and more about that later). Being in SMS together and being members of the BSC are just two of the things that Mallory and I share. Walking home from school, and horse stories, especially stories by Marguerite Henry, are some of the other things we have in common, which is part of the reason we are best friends.\n\nLiking snow and wishing for a real snowstorm might be counted in the things we have in common, too.\n\nBut not dancing. In case you hadn\u2019t guessed, I want to be a ballet dancer someday. I take special lessons and I get up every morning at 5:29 A.M. to practice. My family\u2019s even set up a practice area in the basement for me, and they drive me back and forth to Stamford to study at the Stamford Ballet School.\n\nMallory, on the other hand, hates anything athletic except maybe archery. She wants to be a children\u2019s book writer and illustrator. Maybe, I tell her, one day she\u2019ll write a book about a ballet dancer and use me as the model for the illustrations. Maybe, she tells me, one day I\u2019ll be so famous that I won\u2019t be the model \u2014 maybe the whole book will be about me. And then we\u2019ll both be famous.\n\nThat would be cool.\n\nBut meanwhile, walking home with Mallory (and finishing another day of school) was pretty excellently cool, too.\n\n\u201cYou want to come in?\u201d I asked when we reached my house. \u201cSee if we can make some hot chocolate?\u201d\n\nMallory shook her head and wiped her mitten across her glasses again. \u201cI wish I could, but I have to get home. Mom\u2019s taking Byron, Adam, and Jordan to the dentist this afternoon. I\u2019m going to keep an eye on things while she\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nKeeping an eye on things was putting it mildly. That\u2019s another way Mallory and I are different: I come from a fairly standard sized family and she comes from a huge one. She has seven brothers and sisters, and three of her brothers \u2014 the ones who were going to the dentist \u2014 are identical triplets. Having helped Mal baby\u2011sit for all her brothers and sisters, I know what chaos it can be.\n\nI know it gets to Mal, too, sometimes. But it also makes her an incredibly calm babysitter. Among them, her four brothers have thought up just about every way of getting into trouble, intentionally or not, that seems possible. Almost nothing rattles Mallory now, at least in the baby\u2011sitting department.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you later,\u201d added Mallory. She waved good\u2011bye and headed for home.",

Or a couple of empty trash cans doing a trash\u2011can dance.\n\nSure enough, my baby brother Squirt was sitting on the kitchen floor, banging on an assortment of pots and pans with a metal spoon and various lids. He was wearing a saucepan on his head.\n\nI burst out laughing. \u201cMr. John Philip Ramsey, Junior, you are super cute,\u201d I said.\n\nSquirt didn\u2019t understand all I was saying, but he knew it was good. He smiled a baby\u2011toothed smile at me, which made him look even cuter, and dropped a lid into a frying pan.\n\n\u201cLa la la la BANG!\u201d he said.\n\nAunt Cecelia looked up from the kitchen counter, where she had opened a book.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d I asked. \u201cAre you cooking something special? Are you making dinner tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat about?\u201d\n\nAunt Cecelia made a note on a piece of paper on the counter next to her and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll see soon enough. You aren\u2019t tracking snow and mud into the house, are you? Take your shoes off.\u201d\n\nI hid a smile. That was just like Aunt Cecelia. When she\u2019d first moved in with us to help take care of us after my mom went back to work full\u2011time in advertising (my father already had a full\u2011time job outside the house, but Mama had stopped when I was born), I\u2019d had a real problem with her. I thought she was way too strict and old\u2011fashioned. But I\u2019ve gotten used to her ways and she\u2019s gotten used to mine, and mostly we get along pretty well now.\n\nAnd Squirt loves her.\n\nI took my shoes off and put them by the kitchen door. I hung my coat on the coat rack on the wall above the shoes. Just then, my eight\u2011year\u2011old sister Becca wandered into the kitchen.\n\n\u201cHi, Jessi,\u201d she said.\n\nSquirt did something really loud and creative with his pots\u2011and\u2011pans drum set and Becca covered her ears. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, Squirt!\u201d she practically shouted.\n\n\u201cEnough nice,\u201d said Aunt Cecelia. She bent and scooped Squirt up and pretended to hold him upside down. Squirt shrieked happily.\n\nBecca and I knew what to do. We scooped up Squirt\u2019s pots and pans and put them out of sight. When Aunt Cecelia set him back down, he looked around for a moment, sort of puzzled, then set off at a high\u2011speed crawl across the floor toward the door leading to the hall.\n\nAunt Cecelia wrote something else down on the piece of paper, folded it up, and put it in her pocket. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go do some errands for a little while, Jessi. So I\u2019m going to leave you in charge, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo",

          "text": "Crunch.\n\nClaudia Kishi was eating something sweet and chocolatey. I couldn\u2019t tell what it was, but I sure could smell it.\n\n\u201cJust hold it a few more minutes, Stacey,\u201d she said, peeking around her easel.\n\nI swallowed. That was about all I was allowed to do. That, and blink. If I stretched, talked, even nodded, Claudia would have a cow.\n\nBeing an artist\u2019s model isn\u2019t easy. Especially the way Claudia had posed me. I was staring off into space with a dreamy, thoughtful expression, leaning on one elbow.\n\nMy back was killing me.\n\nWhat was worse, my nose had started to itch. I crinkled it, but that made the itch worse. Then I shook my head quickly.\n\n\u201cUh-uh-uhhh,\u201d Claud warned me.\n\nI held my breath. I tried to imagine a finger scratching my nose. I forced myself to think of something else. A tropical beach \u2026 a sunrise \u2026 a breeze \u2026 wafting gently \u2026 right up my nose\u2026.\n\n\u201cAhhh \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot now, Stacey!\u201d Claudia cried.\n\n\u201cAhhh \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Hold it in!\u201d\n\n\u201cCHOOOO!\u201d\n\nToo late. My hair went flying into my face. My elbow slipped off the armrest. I sent a spray across Claudia\u2019s night table.\n\nI looked at Claudia. She was staring at the table. Her jaw was wide open (which, believe me, was not too attractive). I gulped.\n\n\u201cTr\u00e8s elegant, McGill,\u201d Claudia said.\n\nI tried to hold back a giggle. I was just about to apologize when Claudia lost it. She burst out laughing so hard, she dropped her paintbrush.\n\nMe? I howled.\n\nThe two of us sounded like hyenas. We could not stop. The door to Claudia\u2019s room swung open and her sister, Janine the Genius, peeked in.\n\nShe shook her head. \u201cUh, would you mind lowering the volume a bit?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Claud and I both said.\n\nJanine wandered over to Claudia\u2019s painting and peered at it. \u201cVery, um, creative,\u201d she said.\n\nUh-oh.\n\nI didn\u2019t like the sound of that remark.\n\nAs Janine left, I peeked around Claudia\u2019s easel.\n\nHer painting was \u2026 colorful.\n\nIn fact, it was big splotches of colors. All over the canvas. With no resemblance to a human face.\n\n\u201cYou hate it,\u201d Claudia said.\n\n\u201cNo! I mean, it\u2019s gorgeous, but I guess \u2026 I\u2019m not sure why I had to hold that pose.\u201d I sighed. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t look like me, Claud.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a suggestion of you, Stace,\u201d Claudia explained. \u201cYou know, like your essence. That\u2019s why I used all the golden colors over here. See? And the piercing blue here.\u201d\n\nMy hair was a yellow swirl, my eyes were blue glops, and my clothes were a multicolor smear.\n\nBut I had to admit, it looked cool. Hey, I\u2019ve seen abstract art before. I grew up in New York City, and my parents took me to plenty of museums and art galleries.\n\nNot to mention phenomenal restaurants and boutiques and theaters and festivals.\n\nSigh. Do I sound as if I miss the Big Apple? I do, sometimes. But I get to visit a lot, because my dad still lives there.\n\nI guess I\u2019m lucky, although it\u2019s hard to think of yourself as lucky after your parents divorce. The divorce is the reason Mom and I moved here, to Stoneybrook, Connecticut.\n\nOr I should say, moved back to Stoneybrook. The first time was BD (Before the Divorce), when Dad\u2019s company made him relocate to Connecticut. We\u2019d barely settled in when the company made Dad move back to the Big Apple again. All this moving, and a lot of other things, began wearing my parents down. Suddenly BD gave way to a big, ugly D. Mom wanted to move back to Stoneybrook, Dad wanted to stay in New York \u2014 and I was given a choice. What did I, Stacey McGill, the Ultimate Urbanite, do?\n\nI went with Mom. Why? Because I\u2019d grown to love Stoneybrook. I\u2019d made some pretty cool friends (such as Claudia), and I\u2019d joined the Baby-sitters Club, which, at the time, was about the most important thing in my life. (I\u2019ll tell you about the BSC later.)\n\nOkay, so I don\u2019t see paintings in the Museum of Modern Art as often as I used to. Instead, I pose for a future famous artist. (Talk about talent. Claud can also draw, make jewelry, and sculpt.)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Claudia unwrapped a Twinkie as she squinted at her painting. \u201cI think it needs a little more oomphleesh.\u201d\n\nClaudia is very chic, but she does have a habit of talking with her mouth full. What\u2019s oomphleesh? I didn\u2019t bother asking.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t understand why Claudia does not look like the Goodyear Blimp. She lives on junk food. You should see her room. It\u2019s a dentist\u2019s nightmare \u2014 boxes of Goobers under the pillow, pretzels in the shoe rack, Mallomars on the hat shelf. Everything is hidden because Mr. and Mrs. Kishi are strict about Proper Eating. (Proper Reading, too. Claudia even has to hide her Nancy Drew books, believe it or not.)\n\nAnyway, Claudia the Chocoholic is thin, blemish-free, and stunning. She\u2019s Japanese-American, with gorgeous jet-black hair and almond-shaped eyes. And her outfits are as abstract as her paintings. That day, for example, she was wearing this super-baggy man\u2019s shirt that must have once belonged to a sumo wrestler, enormous light wool black trousers gathered at the waist with a silken sash, and old work boots. Her hair was pulled back with a barrette in the shape of a set of teeth. Very original, very cool.\n\nMe? I\u2019m just as clothes-conscious as Claudia. But my style is less funky. I like sophisticated, up-to-the-minute fashions.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only way Claud and I are different. For one thing, I have blonde hair and blue eyes. For another, I cannot eat junk food. Literally. You see, I\u2019m a diabetic. For me, sugary foods are like poison. My body can\u2019t regulate blood sugar, so I have to inject myself with a hormone called insulin every day. I know, it sounds gross, but believe me, you get used to it.\n\nClaudia broke into a big smile and painted a purple arc over the top right corner of the canvas. \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d she cried. \u201cThat\u2019s what I needed. You know, for balance!\u201d\n\nUh-huh. Sure. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWant some?\u201d Claudia held out an open bag of sesame-seed pretzels (which I can eat).\n\n\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m going out to dinner with Robert tonight. I need to leave room.\u201d (Robert Brewster is my boyfriend.)\n\n\u201cWhere are you two g",

          "text": "\u201cPoor Logan.\u201d Mary Anne sighed as she stared out the rain\u2011drenched window. She was already dressed for school and had come into my bedroom, although I was still running around trying to figure out what to wear.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Logan?\u201d I asked as I tossed a pair of baggy white cotton pants aside. The end of March was still too early for white cotton. At least here in Connecticut it was too early. Back in California it would probably have been fine.\n\nMary Anne turned from the window and pushed aside the bangs of her short brown hair. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not just poor Logan, it\u2019s the entire Stoneybrook Middle School baseball team I feel sorry for. Look at this rain. Their practices have been canceled all week.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho cares,\u201d I said, stepping into a pair of jeans. \u201cThey haven\u2019t lost one game this season. Why do they even need to practice?\u201d\n\nMary Anne looked at me, her brown eyes wide, as if I\u2019d just said something shocking. \u201cDawn, the big game with Howard Township Middle School is next month!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d I shrugged.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, so?\u201d Mary Anne cried. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest game of the season! And this year \u2014 with the great SMS baseball record so far \u2014 it could mean we win the championship.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes! The Stoneybrook Middle School baseball team.\u201d\n\n\u201cLogan Clone Alert!\u201d I teased in a ridiculous robot voice as I pulled my head through a blue hooded sweatshirt. \u201cLogan Clone Alert!\u201d\n\nMary Anne picked the pillow off my bed and threw it at me. \u201cStop that!\u201d\n\nMary Anne\u2019s devotion to Logan\u2019s concerns can be cute sometimes. Other times it can be a little silly, even annoying.\n\nI bent over and let the ends of my long blonde hair touch the rug. Then I began brushing it. \u201cI don\u2019t see why everyone gets so excited about a baseball game. It\u2019s just a game,\u201d I said.\n\nI\u2019m all for sports and physical fitness, but I honestly don\u2019t understand the competitive craziness that goes with it. If the idea is to exercise and have fun, who really cares who wins?\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d lived here your whole life you\u2019d know what a big deal the Howard Township game is,\u201d Mary Anne insisted. \u201cThey\u2019re our arch rivals. It was that way even when our parents went to school together. Every Stoneybrooker knows about Howard.\u201d\n\nI decided to ignore Mary Anne\u2019s little dig about being a native Stoneybrooker. She\u2019d never admit it, but I think she\u2019s still irked that I stayed in California for so long on my last visit. You see, I\u2019m originally from southern California but my mom, my brother, and I came here to Stoneybrook, Connecticut, when my parents split up. My mother grew up in Stoneybrook and her parents (my grandparents) are still here.\n\nSoon after I moved here, Mary Anne and I met at school and became friends. Then my mother started dating Mary Anne\u2019s father whom she\u2019d dated back when they were in high school together. And finally my mother married Mary Anne\u2019s father, which is how Mary Anne and I became stepsisters.\n\nThen, several months ago, I started missing my dad. Also Jeff, my brother, who\u2019d returned to California to live with him. So I went back to visit for a while. Mary Anne tried to be understanding about this, but I think it was hard for her. I think she felt I\u2019d deserted her or something.\n\nBut now I\u2019m back in Stoneybrook and glad to be here. Except, I\u2019m in total clothing confusion. For most of this year I\u2019ve been wearing lightweight, warm\u2011weather clothing (which I love). Since I returned to Stoneybrook in December, I\u2019ve had to dig up all this heavyweight clothing. But I didn\u2019t really want to put my lightweight stuff away because spring is coming. Only, spring is taking its good sweet time about getting here.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d said Mary Anne as she left my room. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late.\u201d",

The score is tied, two outs \u2014 and the batter hits a slow grounder to Jake Kuhn at first\u2026.\"\n\nKristy Thomas was talking.\n\nAnd talking.\n\nMe? I was working hard. Trying to keep my eyes open. If I fell asleep, my face would land in my lunch. And I did not want to go to my next class with hair full of chipped beef with cream sauce.\n\nBaseball is not my favorite topic. It\u2019s not rock bottom, but it\u2019s pretty close. If Kristy had been talking about spelling, or techniques of room cleaning, my nose would already have been in the beef.\n\n\u201cSo what do you think Jake does?\u201d Kristy looked around. Her face was all a\u2011twinkle, as if we were on the edges of our seats.\n\nNow, if you were talking, and you saw three droopy\u2011eyed girls staring back at you, slowly chewing their meals, would you assume they were dying of suspense?\n\n\u201cGive up? He fields the ball and runs home!\u201d\n\nChew, chew, chew. We raised our eyebrows and tried to seem fascinated.\n\n\u201cMaybe he had to go to the bathroom,\u201d I suggested. \u201cThose games are long.\u201d\n\nKristy looked at me blankly for a moment, then snapped, \u201cHome plate, Claudia! See, he wanted to stop the run, even though all he had to do was step on first. Which would have ended the game without a run scored!\u201d\n\nOh.\n\nThe chipped beef was looming closer.\n\nKristy, as you can guess, is a sports fanatic. She\u2019s the founder, manager, and head coach of Kristy\u2019s Krushers, a softball team for little kids.\n\nAre you sitting down? I, Claudia Kishi, Dunce of All Sports, was once the co\u2011coach of the Krushers. Yes, it\u2019s true. When Kristy joined the Stoneybrook Middle School softball team and didn\u2019t have time to coach, my friend Stacey McGill and I took her place.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help. I still don\u2019t know how to play the game.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Kristy said grumpily, \u201cI guess you had to be there.\u201d\n\nShe took her fork and began shoveling in her lunch, as if she hadn\u2019t eaten in days.\n\n\u201cEw, Kristy, please eat with your mouth closed,\u201d Dawn said. \u201cWho wants to watch you chew up murdered mammals?\u201d\n\nKristy burst out laughing so hard, I thought she was going to hurl. \u201cMurdered mammals?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that meat in your mouth was once a living, feeling cow.\u201d Dawn lifted a forkful of lettuce and pointed it at Kristy for emphasis. \u201cHave you ever seen photos of what happens inside a slaughterhouse? The poor, shivering beasts heading toward their death \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDawn, please,\u201d Mary Anne said.\n\nI pushed my lunch aside. Suddenly I wasn\u2019t hungry.\n\nKristy shrugged. \u201cSome people collect dolls. Some collect baseball cards. Dawn Schafer collects pictures of cow torture.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we change the subject?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Mary Anne agreed. \u201cUm \u2026 Logan and I are making a tape tonight. You know, a collection of our favorite songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did that once,\u201d Kristy said.\n\n\u201cThirty\u2011two renditions of \u2018Take Me Out to the Ball Game,\u2019 \u201d I remarked.

If she didn\u2019t like me, she would have thrown something harder.\n\nActually, Kristy has pelted me with a lot of things over the years. We grew up across the street from each other here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. My mom says Kristy used to bop me with her Raggedy Ann because I didn\u2019t learn to walk as fast as she did. (Figures.)\n\nAs I walked home from school that afternoon in the spring sunshine, my jacket slung over my shoulder, I wished Kristy still lived in her old house. On gorgeous afternoons like these, she had all kinds of great outdoorsy plans.\n\n\u201cHi, Janine!\u201d I called to my sister as I breezed in the front door and through the living room.\n\n\u201cHello \u2014\u201d I was halfway up the stairs when Janine saw me. \u201cClaudia, what on Earth are you wearing?\u201d\n\nGulp.\n\nI was wearing a backward T\u2011shirt, overalls I\u2019d made by sewing together two halves cut from different pairs, and mismatched socks. It was my \u201cdeconstructionist\u201d look. You know, like the art movement? Those paintings that show you the parts of objects rearranged in interesting ways? Well, that was the idea, anyway. Cool, huh?\n\nI am obsessed with art. Painting, sculpture, drawing, jewelry\u2011making \u2014 I like to create in any medium. Including clothes. (This makes me Chief Oddball in my family. For my parents, tasseled loafers are daring.)\n\nJanine shook her head, chuckling. \u201cWas that why you wore your jacket to breakfast this morning? To cover that up so we wouldn\u2019t have indigestion?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was cold.\u201d (Well, it was sort of true.)\n\nJanine just shook her head and walked to her room.\n\nLater I could hear the usual furious clacking of the computer keyboard coming from Janine\u2019s room. I tried to slip quietly by her open door, to avoid another comment.\n\n\u201cHm. Frankenstein\u2019s jumpsuit,\u201d I heard as I entered my bedroom.\n\nJanine is disgustingly smart. Even if she lent me, like, one quarter of her IQ points, I\u2019d be brilliant and she\u2019d still have enough left over to be a genius. She is a high school sophomore, but she takes college courses. And her taste in fashion runs to white blouses and gray pleated skirts.\n\nNeedless to say, my parents think she\u2019s perfect.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to be a high achiever like her. But 1) I can\u2019t spell, 2) computers hate me (and vice versa), and 3) my eyes cross when I read anything more complicated than a Nancy Drew mystery.\n\nWhere did my artistic side come from? Probably my mom\u2019s mom, Mimi. She understood me better than anyone else. Mimi\u2019s English wasn\u2019t great (she immigrated to this country from Japan), but it didn\u2019t matter. We were on the same wavelength. She lived with us my whole life and I loved her soooo much. When she died I was devastated.\n\nActually, one other person inherited the crazy, creative genes in my family \u2014 my aunt Peaches, Mimi\u2019s other daughter. (Her real name is Miyoshi. Her husband, my uncle Russ, gave her the nickname. Why? No one knows.) When Peaches was pregnant, she and Russ bought a house in Stoneybrook. While they waited for the occupants to move out, they lived with us for a month. It was a wild and mostly fun t",

          "text": "Pike\u2019s Peak.\n\nThe two words just jumped into my head as I watched Mallory Pike\u2019s seven younger siblings and Pow Barrett Pike, the Pikes\u2019 basset hound, playing a game of freeze tag.\n\nPike\u2019s Peak is this famous mountain out west that was a sort of landmark for the European settlers who were headed for the coast.\n\nBut the Pike\u2019s Peak I was thinking about is written this way: Pikes\u2019 Peak.\n\nBecause the Pikes were at the peak of their energy and activity. Okay, it\u2019s a pretty dumb pun, but peak is an almost quiet way of describing what I was watching. Adam, Byron, and Jordan, who are ten and are identical triplets (although they weren\u2019t dressed alike \u2014 they\u2019d die these days before they\u2019d dress alike, except maybe for a practical joke), were charging around making wild grabs at everybody. Vanessa, who is a budding poet, was dodging madly and shrieking, \u201cFreeze, freeze, if you please!\u201d Nicky, who is eight, and Margo, who is seven, had hunched themselves into horrible, contorted frozen shapes. Claire, who is five, was laughing and jumping out of the way as everyone pretended they were about to grab her and then \u201cmissed.\u201d And Pow was racing in and out among them all howling \u201cHoo, hoo, hoo!,\u201d his big, long ears flapping as he ran.\n\nMallory, who is eleven and a junior member of the Baby-sitters Club (of which I am the secretary, but more about that later) as well as the senior sibling of the Pike family, nudged me with her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re it,\u201d she said with a grin.\n\nI grinned back. We were sitting on the back steps of their house. What were we doing? You guessed it. Baby-sitting. Pike-sitting. The Pikes always ask for two sitters when they call the Baby-sitters Club. Not that the Pikes are bad kids or hard to handle or anything like that. But there are a lot of them and they have tons of energy (see above).\n\nClaire made a grab at Jordan, who toppled over. \u201cI\u2019m frozen, I\u2019m frozen,\u201d he wailed and writhed on the ground before \u201cfreezing\u201d into a pretzel shape.\n\n\u201cYou iced Jordan, Claire,\u201d said Adam. \u201cBut you won\u2019t ice me!\u201d\n\n\u201cBaroo! BarooOOOO!\u201d howled Pow ecstatically.\n\nMal rolled her eyes. \u201cI think all this spring and school-about-to-be-out stuff has gone to the triplets\u2019 heads.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too bad we can\u2019t channel some of that energy and use it for, I don\u2019t know, electricity or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Dawn would approve of that. It would be very environmentally correct.\u201d Mal was talking about Dawn Schafer, who is my stepsister, one of my two best friends, and a fellow member of the BSC. She is also, in case you hadn\u2019t guessed, very environmentally conscious. But more about that later.\n\nI laughed. \u201cI wonder how you\u2019d do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeats me,\u201d Mal said. We sat in comfortable silence for a while and watched the frozen victims all come back to life and start over again.\n\nThen Mal said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe school will be over in just three weeks!\u201d\n\n\u201cMe either. And I can\u2019t wait. I feel like all I\u2019ve been doing lately is studying for tests and doing homework and baby-sitting. I haven\u2019t even had time to clean up my room lately.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your room will still be there.\u201d",

          "text": "I know. But it bugs me. I like to have things neat.\n\nMal grinned. \u201cIn my family, I just like knowing where things are. With eight kids and two adults picking things up and putting them away, watch out!\n\n\u201cHey, when you\u2019ve got a stepmother like Sharon putting things away, watch out!\u201d\n\nWe laughed. Sharon Schafer Spier, who is my stepmother and Dawn\u2019s mother, is, well, an imaginative housekeeper. I\u2019ve found cans of beans on bookshelves and books in the linen closet. Sharon is absentminded that way, just the opposite of my father, the king of neat. But opposites attract, they say. And my father and Sharon are crazy about each other. I\u2019m pretty crazy about Sharon, too. It\u2019s nice having her for a stepmother, and extra nice having Dawn as one of my two best friends and my sister\u2026.\n\nWait a minute. I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. I\u2019m Mary Anne Spier. I\u2019m thirteen years old. I\u2019m kind of short, and I have brown hair and brown eyes. People say I\u2019m sensitive and that\u2019s probably true. Sometimes it\u2019s a pain, because the littlest, dumbest things can make me cry (even some commercials on television). And I\u2019m shy, too. On the other hand, I think being sensitive and shy helps me listen to people and be more understanding.\n\nI live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where I\u2019m in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. I\u2019ve lived here all my life, most of the time as an only child and a half orphan.\n\nHalf-orphan sounds sad, I guess. But my mother died when I was just a baby, so I can\u2019t really remember her. My father raised me by himself.\n\nMy father was strict, but loving. He was, as I got older, a little overprotective. He was so worried about being a single parent that I guess he was overcompensating. Anyway, for a long time, he made me wear my hair in braids and chose all these really little kid clothes for me. But with the help of my friends, I was finally able to bring him around. I can buy any kind of clothes I want now (within reason) and I even got a new haircut not too long ago. I also got a kitten named Tigger.\n\nThere\u2019s Logan, too. Logan is the cutest boy in all of SMS and possibly Stoneybrook. He looks just like Cam Geary, the star (okay, so I\u2019m not that objective, but still, it\u2019s true). He\u2019s from Kentucky originally and has this cool southern accent.\n\nAnd he\u2019s my boyfriend. See how much my father\u2019s changed?\n\nBut that\u2019s not the biggest change in my father\u2019s life \u2014 or mine, for that matter. The biggest change is Sharon.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Dawn\u2019s mom.\n\nYou see, Sharon grew up in Stoneybrook. In fact, years ago she used to date my father. But they lost touch after high school and Sharon ended up in California. Then when Dawn\u2019s mom and dad got divorced, Sharon moved back to her hometown with her two children, Dawn and Dawn\u2019s younger brother, Jeff.\n\nThat\u2019s where we come in. Dawn and I had already become best friends (in fact, I\u2019m the one who suggested that",

          "text": "Smack.\n\nMy palm landed on the snooze button of my clock radio. With a groan, I turned toward my bedroom wall.\n\nMy dream was fading. In it, I, Stacey McGill, was gliding over New York City at night with my boyfriend, Robert Brewster. (How were we doing this? Probably a magic carpet or something. I don\u2019t know. It was a dream.) We passed above West 81st Street, and I could see my old apartment building, glowing like an electronic toy.\n\nAs the clock radio went off, Robert and I were swooping down toward my former living room window.\n\nBut, of course, we never arrived.\n\nOh, well. It was time to wake up and prepare for school anyway. I pulled my covers off, slid my feet to the floor, yawned, and staggered upright.\n\nMy eyes weren\u2019t totally functioning until I reached my door.\n\nUnfortunately, neither was my brain. I suddenly remembered something extremely important.\n\nIt was summer vacation.\n\nSchool was out.\n\nI had set my alarm by mistake.\n\nDuh.\n\nI plopped back on my bed and tried to go to sleep again, but my dream was gone. And every time I drifted off, I could hear my mom rattling around in the kitchen, making herself breakfast.\n\nBy the time she left for work, I was wide\u2011awake.\n\nAs I rose out of bed, I spotted a letter from Robert on my desk. He had written it to me on one of the last days of school. Hey, Toots! it said across the top.\n\nI smiled. \u201cToots\u201d was what a grocer around the corner from my New York City apartment called all his female customers. (It drove everyone crazy.) I had imitated him for Robert, and he thought it was hilarious. Unfortunately, he started calling me Toots, too.\n\nI hate that name.\n\nBut I forgive Robert. Besides, all I have to do is call him Dimples, and he stops.\n\nI really wanted to see Robert that day, but he was helping some high school friends paint houses during the week \u2014 and of course, they were hired to paint this humongous mansion with about twenty\u2011three miles of white wooden shingles.\n\nSo what else could I do that day? Not much. Call my friend Andi, who was leaving on a family vacation (lucky her). Do a little shopping, maybe. Find out if anyone wanted to hang with me this afternoon. Just another lazy Connecticut summer day.\n\nNew York City was still on my brain as I shuffled to my closet. When I lived in NYC, my summer days were never like this. They were jam\u2011packed: tennis lessons in Central Park, weekend trips to Jones Beach, browsing in the Columbus Avenue shops, visiting Soho art galleries, lunching with Mom and my friends at the Garden Cafe in the Museum of Natural History.\n\nSigh.\n\nYes, I miss the Big Apple. (I bet you couldn\u2019t tell, right?) I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s an awesome place. You simply cannot be bored there, even if you try. I should know. I lived there from birth until I was twelve (I\u2019m thirteen now). Then came the Great Shuffle (my dad\u2019s company transferred him to Stoneybrook and then back to New York again) and the Big Chill (my parents divorced). All of a sudden, life was a mess. Mom and Dad had joint custody of me, and they gave me the choice of where to live \u2014 with Mom in Stoneybrook or with Dad in NYC. And I, Stacey McGill, the biggest New York lover in the world, chose Stoneybrook. Why? Mainly because of the friends I\u2019d made here. Also, it\u2019s nice to walk outside and see thick, shady trees. (The trees in New York are scrawny. They have to be; otherwise their roots interfere with the underground wires and pipes.)\n\nDo I ever regret my decision? You bet. Especially on a summer day with nothing to do.\n\nI opened my closet door and looked at all my options. Jeans? Worn yesterday, with a U4Me T\u2011shirt (U4Me is my current fave rock group). Flowered minidress? The day before. Black\u2011striped baggy shorts? The day before that, with an oversized white sweatshirt.\n\nI rummaged through a pile of T\u2011shirts and some of last year\u2019s outfits. I tried on a pair of cream\u2011colored drawstring pants, but they were so worn, the cream was beginning to yellow.\n\nFinally I settled on a midnight\u2011blue\u2011and\u2011white striped hooded sweatshirt with a laced placket, and matching Spandex leggings.\n\nI looked in the mirror. I immediately wished I hadn\u2019t. My hair looked like a blonde birds\u2019 nest, and I could go shopping with the bags under my eyes.\n\nBut my outfit was fine.\n\nDo I sound too clothes\u2011conscious to you? My mom thinks so. She has started calling my dressing ritual SDT, Stacey\u2019s Daily Trauma.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a trauma at all. I enjoy it. I mean, choosing clothes is not like choosing vegetables or cans of soup. It\u2019s a skill. You have to take into account the season, the weather, your mood, and what you wore the previous day, just for starters. You know how it is.\n\nAnyway, my outfit was sophisticated yet casual, with a nautical hint. Sort of like a summer day in NYC.\n\nSigh.",

The Great Divide is not to be confused with the Great Shuffle and the Big Chill. The Great Divide happened when I left the Baby\u2011sitters Club. Well, left and was thrown out at the same time. It was kind of mutual.\n\nI loved being in the BSC. The members were my best friends. We went to school together (still do, when it\u2019s not summertime), had meetings three times a week, baby\u2011sat together, even went on vacations together. You can\u2019t be much closer than that. As you can imagine, I devoted most of my free time to my friends. And I did, happily.\n\nThen I met Robert, and everything started",

We (Mom, my younger brother Jeff, and I) moved here when I was in the seventh grade.\n\nMom grew up in Stoneybrook, but went to college in California, which was where she met my dad. After they divorced, I guess Mom wanted to be closer to her parents (who are my grandparents, of course). So we moved to Stoneybrook and bought this really old farmhouse. (And I do mean old! It was built in 1795.)\n\nJeff, who is ten now, didn\u2019t take well to living in Stoneybrook. He missed Dad, he couldn\u2019t get used to the cold weather, and he missed his friends. So he made the painful decision to move back to California and live with Dad.\n\nI know how Jeff felt, because earlier this year I started feeling the same way. I started missing Dad, California, and my friends.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. There are lots of things I love about living here in Stoneybrook. I get along great with Mom. (She\u2019s kind of messy and scatter\u2011)\n\nI even like our house, though on cold, windy nights it does seem eerie and creaky with its small rooms, low ceilings, and uneven, shadowy corners. But it\u2019s a pretty cool house. There\u2019s even a secret passage that runs from my bedroom to the barn out back! (How\u2019s that for spooky?)\n\nPlus, there\u2019s the BSC with all my good friends who belong to it and the adorable kids we sit for. They\u2019ve become a big, important part of my life here in Stoneybrook.",

Whirrrrrrr! went the construction crew two houses away.\n\nEeeeeeeeee droned the cicadas in the backyard trees.\n\nI was in the garage, rounding up softball equipment. It was a hot, noisy Friday morning at the end of the summer, four days before the start of school and eight days before the World Series. Our World Series, that is. See, I\u2019m founder, manager, and head coach of a team called Kristy\u2019s Krushers. The team is named after me, Kristy Thomas.\n\n\"Kristyyyyyy!\"\n\nI looked out the garage door, toward the back of my house. David Michael was scampering toward me, grinning.\n\nClatter-clatter, bonk, crash! Four aluminum bats fell to the garage floor. One of them smashed me on the left big toe.\n\n\"Yeeeeow!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Kristyyyy!\" David Michael shouted again.\n\nI did not have a cow. I kept my cool. I stood up and calmly replied, \u201cWHAT?\u201d\n\nPicture the Road Runner stopping short and leaving skid marks behind him. That was my brother.\n\n\"Why are you yelling?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am not yelling!\" I yelled.\n\n\"Why are the bats on the floor?\"\n\nWhaack! Thump! Whirrrrrrr! the construction crew answered. The cicadas hummed along.\n\nBoy, it was one of those days.\n\nLately I\u2019d been having a lot of \u201cthose days.\u201d The cicadas had been at it since the beginning of August. (Do your neighborhood trees have them? They are so loud!) The workers had started a couple of weeks later. I am convinced they take noise training classes. Each morning at seven-thirty sharp, the banging began, along with the buzzing, bonking, beeping, drilling, and shouting. I\u2019d stopped setting my alarm. I didn\u2019t need it anymore.\n\nNormally I am an early bird. And, to tell the truth, I can be pretty noisy myself. (Just ask my friends.) But this was going too far.\n\nI couldn\u2019t wait to start a nice, peaceful softball practice.\n\nDavid Michael was flexing his arm in front of my face. His teeth were gritted. \u201cFeel this, Kristy,\u201d he grunted, nodding toward his biceps.\n\nWell, biceps was a strong word. Bump was more like it. David Michael is seven years old.\n\nSighing, I wrapped my hand around his skinny little arm and squeezed. \u201cWow.\u201d I tried to sound enthusiastic, but it wasn\u2019t easy. I was thinking about my sore toe, the garage floor strewn with bats, and the fact that practice began in ten minutes.\n\nAnd I hate hate hate lateness.\n\n\"I am really strong!\" David Michael exclaimed.\n\n\"You sure are. I wonder how many bats you can carry to the field.\"\n\nThat did it. David Michael bent down and scooped up three of the bats. As he lumbered out of the garage, huffing and puffing, the bats waggled up and down. \u201cSee?\u201d he said.\n\n\"Fantastic!\" I let him have his moment of glory.\n\nAround another bat I looped the handles of our worn-out equipment duffel bag (which contains balls; an old, taped-up plastic batting tee; a wrench; electrician\u2019s tape; a first-aid kit; a batting helmet; and a few gloves). I rested the bat on my shoulder so the bag hung over my back. Then I followed my brother down the driveway.",

I founded the Baby-sitters Club, or BSC, and we are about the most kid-friendly, kid-knowledgeable group in the greater Southern Connecticut area.\n\nMy BSC friends call me an Idea Machine. I don\u2019t know about the Machine part, but the Idea part is true.\n\nFor example: you\u2019ve probably already guessed that I\u2019m a sports-lover. Well, I noticed that some of our BSC charges enjoyed softball, but they weren\u2019t ready for Little League.\n\nWould I let them be doomed to sit around, moping, never learning the finer points of our national pastime? No way.\n\nKristy\u2019s Krushers was born.\n\nHow is the team? Pretty bad, if you want to know the truth. But the idea is to have fun and learn basic skills, that\u2019s all.\n\nOf course, demolishing Bart\u2019s Bashers in the World Series would be nice, too.\n\nDid I mention I\u2019m a little competitive? I am. (So\u2019s Bart. Bart Taylor, that is. Even though our teams are adversaries, he\u2019s kind of my boyfriend. So as you can see, my competitiveness isn\u2019t too out of control.)\n\nBefore I go on, you should probably know a few other things about me. I\u2019m thirteen and five feet tall. I\u2019m in the eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. I have brown eyes and long brown hair. I never wear face paint (er, makeup), and my earlobes have not been stabbed (er, pierced). I wear comfortable, casual clothes all the time. If that\u2019s not enough to pick me out of a crowd, I\u2019m the one who talks a lot and has the strongest opinions.",

I come from far, far away.\n\nOkay, I come from Long Island, which is not all that far from Stoneybrook. But sometimes it seems like another planet.\n\nI mean I have things in common with the local flora and fauna, and I\u2019m starting to make friends, but I feel like an alien sometimes. I talk faster, I walk faster, I think faster. And sometimes I say things that make people\u2019s mouths drop open and their eyes pop out.\n\nMy schtick is different. (Schtick is a great Yiddish word, isn\u2019t it? Yiddish is an old Germanic language originally spoken chiefly by Jews from eastern Europe, which is where my family is from originally.) Schtick, by the way, sort of means \u201cthe things I do that make me me.\u201d\n\nI have a picture of me playing soccer on my team in Long Island (I was the star forward, the leading scorer, and the co\u2011captain) and it\u2019s a blur. You can tell who I am, but I am definitely moving fast. What I\u2019m doing in that picture (I remember that game well) is leaving the other team in the dust. Watching the defense scramble after me to try in vain to stop me. Scoring. Making their goalie hate the sight of me.\n\nBut the picture represents how I feel. A blur. Moving fast. And then wondering why the only people who are keeping up with me are the ones who are trying to slow me down.\n\nI stuck Aretha in the CD player and cranked her up. My homework could wait.\n\nWalls of boxes lined most of the rooms. Although we\u2019d had an interior decorator get the house ready before we\u2019d arrived, and even though we\u2019d delayed moving in just to make sure that everything was right, we still hadn\u2019t unpacked most of our stuff. Mom had plunged back into work even more vigorously than ever. (Her recent big promotion meant that we could move to Stoneybrook, and into a big new house.) Anna had resubmerged in her music, particularly her violin studies, and I just haven\u2019t been motivated.\n\nAs for my father \u2026 he died in a car accident when I was nine years old.\n\nSo that\u2019s our family. Absent, mostly.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way. When my father was alive there were only four of us, but somehow, it seemed like more. We were always cooking. Literally. My mom liked to cook. She had started training as a chef at a place in New York called the Culinary Institute of America. When Anna and I were kids she taught cooking at a local college. My father was deeply involved in environmental engineering and urban planning. (Believe me, Long Island could use all the environmental help it could get. Like it has this incredible stretch of land called the Pine Barrens that some people still want to turn into parking lots!) I remember my parents used to joke about designing an environmentally correct restaurant and building it in a tree.\n\nAnna and I actually had a treehouse. For our birthday one year, when we were little, we held a picnic dinner in the treehouse. Dad lowered a bucket on a string \u2014 Anna and I \u201chelped\u201d \u2014 and Mom put the food in the bucket. Then she climbed up to j",

Janine just looked at me.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pun,\u201d I explained.\n\n\u201cWe know,\u201d said my mother. She smiled a little bit.\n\n\u201cAs a humorous application of a word designed to play on two of its meanings, it was somewhat funny,\u201d said Janine. \u201cNow, may I please have the milk?\u201d\n\nOkay, so maybe breakfast time is a little early for jokes. And maybe someone like me shouldn\u2019t be making jokes about passing and failing.\n\nI picked up the milk carton and handed it to my sister.\n\nTrust Janine to have the definition of pun right on the tip of her tongue. She is very familiar with the word \u201cpass\u201d as used to mean doing your schoolwork right. In fact, Janine has not only passed every course she\u2019s ever taken with triple A pluses or something, she\u2019s also taking courses at the local college, even though she\u2019s still in high school. That\u2019s because my sister, who has no sense of humor at the breakfast table, is a genuine genius.\n\nNot me. At least, not when it comes to school. I\u2019m much more familiar with the opposite of pass. You know, that word, fail, which means doing your schoolwork wrong. School bores me. Homework bores me. I don\u2019t understand math, and I think the rules for spelling are much too rigid. Naturally, neither my teachers nor my parents agree. My father likes math so much he works at an investment firm and my mother likes to read so much she is a librarian.\n\nThey don\u2019t understand how they could have a daughter like me.\n\nI mean, numbers are not my thing, and neither are words (except in Nancy Drew books, which for some reason my parents don\u2019t like). I\u2019m an artist. Colors and shapes and designs and textures \u2014 that\u2019s more like it. The world is an amazing-looking place, if you know how to look at it. And it\u2019s much more fun to describe it with images than with words.\n\nSo Janine goes on being a genius, and I work on my art every chance I get. And someone checks my homework every night to make sure I don\u2019t fail.\n\n\u201cPass the marmalade, please,\u201d I said. My sister gave it to me without comment.\n\nThere was a distressing lack of junk food on the table (I\u2019m a junk food connoisseur) but I made up for it by stirring several spoonfuls of orange marmalade into my oatmeal. I saw Janine making a face, and I was afraid for a moment that she might launch into a lecture on Good Nutrition. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nI could have chosen grape jelly, but it didn\u2019t fit in with my color scheme for the day. Since it was the end of October, I was wearing autumn colors: red, orange, yellow. I liked the effect I\u2019d created. It was sort of post-modernist pumpkin.\n\nOh. Wait a minute. Before I describe what I look like, I guess I should say who I am.\n\nI am Claudia Kishi. I am thirteen years old and I\u2019m an eighth-grader at Stoneybrook Middle School in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I have long black hair and dark brown eyes and pierced ears \u2014 one hole in my left earlobe and two holes in my right one. I live on Bradford Court, where I have lived all my life, with my mother, my father, and Janine. My grandmother, Mimi, who was my best friend, lived with us, too, until she died not long ago. I still miss Mimi.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I work very hard on my art. It is, needless to say, one of the few subjects I do well in at school. I\u2019ve even had my own art show, which I held in the garage. The theme was junk food images.\n\nBesides being an artist, I am the vice-president of the Baby-sitters Club, or BSC. That\u2019s because I am one of the founding members of the club, and also because I have my own phone line in my room. But I\u2019ll tell you more about the club later.\n\nNow, where was I? Oh. Right. My autumn fashion colors. I\u2019d put on a pair of baggy pants, not blue, not black, but yellow. With these I was wearing my red Doc Martens, laced with orange and yellow laces, and this great, funky, enormous shirt that I found in a vintage clothes shop. It has a leaf pattern on it. The leaves are in a Hawaiian print design, and the colors are fabulous. Underneath I was wearing my red and yellow tie-dyed long underwear shirt. To complete the ensemble, I had on earrings that I\u2019d made myself, shaped like pumpkins, and a fringed yellow-and-white scarf tied around my hair.\n\nI looked (I modestly admit) pretty great. I did not look as if I belonged with the other three people sitting at the table. My mom wore a tailored navy dress with little pearl earrings. My father was wearing a navy pinstripe suit (the jacket was hanging on the back of his chair). Janine was practically a rainbow by comparison: She was dressed in a navy wool skirt and a navy v-neck sweater over a pink oxford shirt.\n\nI finished my oatmeal. Then Mom and Dad left for work, Janine left for high school, and I grabbed my jacket (yellow, with big black buttons, also from the vintage clothes shop) and went outside to wait for my friends, so we could walk to SMS together.",

          "text": "\u201cMallory, what\u2019s friddiggity?\u201d asked my sister Margo.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d I said with a start.\n\nDid I have any idea she was snooping over my shoulder while I was writing? Nooooo. She was supposed to be working on a Christmas project with Claire and Vanessa, my other sisters.\n\n\u201cFrid diggity dog!\u201d Claire collapsed on the living room floor, giggling.\n\nThat made my brothers Nicky and Jordan race into the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d asked Nicky.\n\n\u201cI thought you were cutting out snowflakes,\u201d I scolded Margo, \u201cnot spying.\u201d\n\nJordan rolled his eyes. \u201cDid she need to ask permission, Your Highness?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, Mallory,\u201d Margo said sheepishly.\n\n\u201cDig miggidy mog!\u201d Claire squealed.\n\n\u201cI said, what\u2019s so funny?\u201d demanded Nicky.\n\n\u201cYour face,\u201d called my brother Adam from the kitchen.\n\nHe and Byron (yes, another brother) howled with laughter.\n\n\u201cOkay, guys, dinnertime!\u201d called my dad.\n\n\u201cDaaaaaaad, they\u2019re teasing me again!\u201d Nicky whined, running into the kitchen.\n\nI closed my spiral notebook and stood up. Near the fireplace, Vanessa was busy writing poetry in a composition book. \u201cCome on, Vanessa,\u201d I urged her.\n\n\u201cIn a minute,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of a rhyme for \u2018reindeer.\u2019 \u201d\n\nI followed Margo into the kitchen. \u201cI want some friddiggity for dessert.\u201d she announced.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s friddiggity?\u201d Mom asked.\n\n\u201cDog diggity fridge,\u201d Claire replied.\n\nDad spun around. \u201cThe dog\u2019s in the fridge?\u201d\n\nAs Byron fell off his chair in hysterics, Adam yanked open the refrigerator and gasped. \u201cPow\u2019s frozen solid!\u201d\n\nPoor Claire turned bone-white.\n\nDo you live in a monkey house? I do. My life story will be called Mallory and the Seven Simian Siblings. (Isn\u2019t simian a great word? It means \u201cof or relating to monkeys.\u201d)\n\nI, Mallory Pike, am Eldest Monkey. I\u2019m eleven and I\u2019m in sixth grade. Maybe you\u2019ve figured out that I want to be a professional writer someday. (Don\u2019t judge the story I was writing, though. That was just a first draft.) On the day you see me accepting a Newbery medal, I will have clear blue eyes and perfect teeth. And maybe my red hair will be less unruly. Now, however, I wear braces and glasses. And my hair is a sight. Contacts would change my life, but my parents believe I am a baby and refuse to let me have them. \u201cOut of the question until you\u2019re fifteen,\u201d says my father.\n\nOf course, Mom and Dad aren\u2019t nearly as strict with my brothers and sisters. That is the worst part about being Eldest Monkey. Honestly, by the time Claire is eleven, she\u2019ll have an apartment of her own, a personal butler, and a salary.\n\nClaire, by the way, is five. Margo\u2019s seven, Nicky\u2019s eight, and Vanessa\u2019s nine. Adam, Jordan, and Byron are ten-year-old triplets.\n\nThe triplets were snickering at Claire. She was looking through the back door, making sure our dog, Pow, was still alive and in his house. Margo and I reached into a drawer by the stove to pull out our usual load of silverware (Dad calls it \u201cthe armament\u201d).\n\nNicky was sniffing loudly. \u201cWhat stinks?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you referring to my gourmet lamb stew?\u201d Dad said, stirring a big pot on the stove.\n\n\u201cLamb stew?\u201d Byron looked horrified.\n\nVanessa strolled into the kitchen, reciting, \u201cLamb stew, lamb stew. Start with some herbs, then chop up the ewe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a ewe?\u201d Claire asked.\n\n\u201cA female lamb,\u201d Vanessa replied.\n\n\u201cEwwwww!\u201d Margo cried.\n\nVanessa grinned. \u201cExactly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho ever heard of Christmas lamb stew?\u201d Jordan protested. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to do Christmasy stuff, remember?\u201d\n\nMom raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat, exactly, do you consider a Christmasy dinner?\u201d\n\n\u201cTurkey,\u201d Jordan replied.\n\n\u201cGoose,\u201d Margo said.\n\nAdam honked.\n\n\u201cGingerbread men,\u201d Claire suggested.\n\n\u201cPeople,\u201d I corrected her.\n\n\u201cPeople?\u201d Claire burst out laughing. \u201cSilly, we\u2019re not canimals.\u201d\n\n\u201cI meant gingerbread people,\u201d I said. \u201cNot just gingerbread men. And it\u2019s cannibals.\u201d\n\nMom was looking at us as if we\u2019d lost our minds. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could make figgy pudding,\u201d Vanessa piped up.\n\n\u201cWhaaaat?\u201d Nicky said.\n\n\u201cYou know, like the song.\u201d Vanessa began singing to the tune of \u201cWe Wish You a Merry Christmas\u201d: \u201cOh, bring us some figgy pudding, oh, bring us some figgy pudding \u2026\u201d\n\nI told you our house is crazy.\n\nOkay, I have to admit, part of it was my fault. I had dreamed up a master plan for the Christmas season, and everyone was contributing to it.\n\nThe idea had hit me the day before, which also happened to be the day after Thanksgiving. At the time, I was Jezebel Cassoulet. My best friend, Jessica Ramsey (called Jessi), was my sister, Daphne. We were French refugees, visiting London for the first time.\n\nActually we were walking down Main Street of Stoneybrook, Connecticut (that\u2019s where we live). The stores had already installed their holiday window displays, a snow flurry was falling, and a Santa on the corner was ringing a bell for a charity. The street looked like a quaint village in nineteenth-century England, if you squinted and tried to ignore the neon signs, electrical wires, and cars.\n\nDaphne and I linked arms to protect each other against the rough climate and the gruff people with their odd accents. Perhaps we would find a kind stranger who would welcome us with the hospitality and cheer of the season \u2014\n\n\u201cPreholiday countdown!\u201d a voice blared over a loudspeaker. \u201cOpen a charge account and receive a free gift while supplies last. For all your holiday needs, Whatley\u2019s is the spirit of shopping. Remember, Christmas and Hanukkah are us!\u201d\n\nMy eyes unsquinted. After the voice stopped, the loudspeaker began playing a tinny version of \u201cJingle Bell Rock.\u201d Two kids skateboarded around us, yelling, \u201cYo, heads up!\u201d A car horn rang out in the street as someone made a sudden U-turn. Outside Whatley\u2019s, a little boy was throwing a tantrum, shooting his mom with a plastic gun.\n\nSo much for nineteenth-century England.\n\nJessi and I looked in the window of Whatley\u2019s. A Santa mannequin was trimming a white plastic tree that blinked WHATLEY\u2019S in purple neon script. Beside him were a dirty bag of coal labeled NAUGHTY and a huge Wha",

(It\u2019s so hard to find things while wearing woolen gloves!)\n\nWhen I finally unlocked the door, it felt good to be inside my warm house. With a shiver I peeled off my hot pink parka. \"Oh, my gosh!\" I laughed as I tried to pull off my pink beret. The hat tugged at my blonde permed hair.\n\n\"Wow,\" Robert said. \"Your house is so quiet.\"\n\nI paused and listened. The only noise was the gentle thunk of the boiler as it kicked on. It was pretty silent. I guess I hadn\u2019t noticed before.\n\n\"Doesn\u2019t it give you the creeps?\" Robert asked, taking off his jacket.\n\n\"No,\" I answered. \"Why should it?\"\n\n\"I\u2019m just not used to coming home to an empty house, I suppose,\" Robert replied. \"When I get home there\u2019s always someone around.\"\n\n\"Mom will be home at six,\" I told him. She works for Bellair\u2019s department store. She\u2019s a buyer, which means she decides what Bellair\u2019s will sell.\n\nMy dad was at his office in Manhattan. But I wouldn\u2019t see him for another week and a half. That\u2019s because my parents are divorced. Mom and I live here in Connecticut. Dad still lives in Manhattan, where I lived for most of my life.\n\nAs I led Robert into the kitchen, the phone rang. \"Hello?\" I said, snapping up the receiver.\n\n\"Stacey, it\u2019s Dad,\" my father\u2019s voice said from the other end.\n\n\"Dad, hi! What\u2019s up?\"\n\n\"I just thought I\u2019d call to see how you are. I figured you might be lonely there all alone till your mother gets home.\"\n\n\"Oh, I\u2019m not alone. Robert\u2019s here with me,\" I told him.\n\nThere was silence on the other end of the phone. \"Dad?\" I asked. \"Are you there?\"\n\nDad coughed. \"I\u2019m here. Uh \u2026 is it all right with your mother if Robert\u2019s in the house when she\u2019s not around?\" he asked in an anxious voice.\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" I told him honestly. \"You\u2019ve met Robert. He\u2019s cool. We\u2019re just going to do some homework here in the kitchen. That\u2019s Mom\u2019s rule. We stay in the kitchen.\"\n\n\"All right, I suppose,\" said Dad. \"That\u2019s probably all right.\"\n\nI opened the refrigerator and handed Robert a bottle of raspberry-flavored seltzer while Dad and I talked briefly about a Broadway musical he\u2019d seen the night before. He loved it and said he\u2019d be willing to see it again with me when I came down to visit. \"Want to do Broadway with your old dad?\" he teased.\n\n\"Absolutely. Get tickets!\" I told him enthusiastically. I adore Manhattan, and my dad is really fun. So I love doing things in Manhattan with him. It\u2019s a great combination.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I like Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where I live now. But it\u2019s not nearly as exciting as the city.

Being diabetic means eating a lot of small meals and healthy snacks throughout the day. And I do mean healthy snacks. Sugar can send my body into orbit. Serious stuff. I could go into a coma, even die, if I cheat on treats. So I watch what I eat, test my blood sugar level regularly, and give myself insulin injections every day.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt about it. Having diabetes is a major drag.\n\nHaving divorced parents is a drag, too.\n\nBut, hey, those are the facts of my life, so I might as well make the best of things. Most of the time I don\u2019t let the divorce or the diabetes get me down.\n\n\"Want a carrot?\" I asked, turning back to Robert.\n\n\"No, thanks.\"\n\nRobert sat at the kitchen table. \"Do you think you\u2019ll move back to the city when you\u2019re older?\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know,\" I admitted. \"Maybe. Probably.\"\n\nRobert sighed comically. \"You\u2019ll leave all us country folk behind and go for the glamour,\" he teased.\n\n\"You\u2019re not exactly Farmer Rob,\" I pointed out as I sat beside him.\n\n\"I know, but I wouldn\u2019t like living in the city. I\u2019ve only been there a few times and it seemed so noisy and big.\"\n\n\"Who cares about a little noise? And the bigness makes it exciting,\" I countered.\n\n\"No, the city isn\u2019t for me.\"\n\n\"I bet I could make a city lover out of you,\" I said, lightly squeezing his hand. \"You just haven\u2019t seen the good parts yet. You need someone like me to guide you. For example, during the day Broadway looks sort of seedy but at night, when it\u2019s all lit up, it\u2019s magic.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve never even been to Broadway, Stacey.\"\n\n\"Well, then someday we\u2019ll go. Together,\" I said. \"You\u2019ll love it.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know.\" Robert shook his head. \"I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever agree about this one.\"\n\n\"We could,\" I said optimistically. \"Once I give you the Stacey McGill super city tour you\u2019ll be as big a fan as I am. Oh, Robert, I wish you could see the city the way I do. It\u2019s so amazing. Every corner has some interesting discover\"",

          "text": "Riding the bus is not exactly my favorite thing to do, but that day I felt pretty lucky. Inside it was so nice and warm, I didn\u2019t even notice the pukey green color of the walls and ceiling.\n\nOf all my closest friends, only Abby and her twin sister live bus\u2011distance from school. Our neighborhood is in the countryish section of Stoneybrook, Connecticut. Some people call it the rich section. I don\u2019t, because that would make me sound snobby.\n\nAnd I, Kristy Thomas, am the exact opposite of a snob. I\u2019m also hard\u2011working, cheerful, lovable, fair, and very take\u2011charge. Oh, and modest, too. (Please don\u2019t barf, I\u2019m just stating facts.)\n\nMore facts: I\u2019m thirteen years old. I\u2019m in the eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. I have shoulder\u2011length brown hair and dark\u2011brown eyes. I\u2019m five feet tall and I dress casually all the time.\n\nI live in a huge house, sort of a mansion, because my stepdad is a millionaire. My family is highly blended. (Don\u2019t you love that word? It makes us sound like a big banana milkshake.) Actually, it means my mom and stepdad each had families before they married each other. The Thomas part of the blend includes my mom, my three brothers (Charlie\u2019s seventeen, Sam\u2019s fifteen, and David Michael\u2019s seven and a half), and my grandmother, Nannie. Nannie moved in with us to help take care of Emily Michelle, my adopted sister who was born in Vietnam. My stepdad, Watson Brewer, has a seven\u2011year\u2011old daughter (Karen) and a four\u2011year\u2011old son (Andrew) who live with us every other month. Our pets are BooBoo the cat, Shannon the puppy, and two goldfish named Crystal Light the Second and Goldfishie. Whenever Karen and Andrew arrive, they bring Emily Junior the rat and Bob the hermit crab.\n\nGot all that? Good, because I\u2019ll be giving you a quiz later on.\n\nJust joking.\n\nOkay, I might as well say it right now. I do have a sense of humor. Despite what my friends might tell you. They\u2019ll say I\u2019m loud, bossy, and opinionated.\n\nHard to believe, I know. First of all, I\u2019m only opinionated when I know I\u2019m right. Maybe I go overboard, but I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m a real solutions person. If I see a problem, boooinnng, my mind springs into action. When others are still in the head\u2011scratching stage, I already have an answer. My friends call me the Idea Machine.\n\nHow did I become like this? Practice. My family may be comfortable now, but life used to be full of problems. When I was a little kid, right after David Michael was born, my dad abandoned our family. Mom had a lot to handle, and I thought of all kinds of ways to help out.\n\nOne of my all\u2011time best ideas, the Babysitters Club, occurred to me one day when Mom had trouble finding a sitter for David Michael. My solution was simple: a group of reliable sitters who meet regularly to take phone calls and assign jobs. Not only did it help my mom, but it changed forever the lives of many Stoneybrook parents.\n\nThank you, thank you. Don\u2019t applaud, just send clients. (Kidding!)\n\nAs for being bossy, well, I have to be. I\u2019m club president. I have to be loud, too. Come to a meeting someday and you\u2019ll know why.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got all that straight, back to the bus on that frozen March afternoon.\n\nAbby had already found a seat and was gabbing away. I walked to the back of the bus to sit next to her twin sister, Anna.\n\nAbby and Anna are my newest friends. They moved to Stoneybrook from Long Island. Their mom works in New York City, for a publishing company. (I know their dad died a few years ago in a car accident, but they haven\u2019t spoken much about him.) They\u2019re identical twins, technically. But boy, are they different. Abby\u2019s kind of goofy and loud, not too studious, and pretty athletic. Her hair is dark brown and bouncy, she has asthma, and she\u2019s allergic to about five million things. Anna\u2019s quiet and thoughtful and a really talented musician (she\u2019s played violin in a professional orchestra). Her hair is shorter than Abby\u2019s, she doesn\u2019t care about sports, and she hasn\u2019t the slightest trace of an allergy.\n\nB",

          "text": "\u201cAbby? Abby!\u201d\n\nI looked up from where I was sitting on the sidelines of the soccer field and grinned and waved. My twin sister, Anna, and her violin were standing there.\n\nWell, okay, the violin wasn\u2019t standing there. My sister was holding it in its case under one arm, while she waved to me with the other.\n\nI finished lacing up my sneaks, jammed my cleats in my pack, and stood up to join her.\n\nAlthough my sister and I are twins, we are identical only in appearance. We both have deep brown eyes that are almost black; we both wear glasses or contacts (depending on our moods); we both have dark brown, thick, curly hair, and pointed chins. But Anna wears her hair shorter than mine, with bangs. And although she is coordinated, she isn\u2019t athletic. Her talent is music, and while I like to listen to music, I couldn\u2019t carry a tune in a bucket.\n\nAnna is first chair in the Stoneybrook Middle School orchestra, which means she is really, really good on the violin. She also plays the piano and she\u2019s been known to do a few turns on our father\u2019s old harmonica. In fact, I bet Anna could play any instrument on earth after only a couple of tries.\n\nAlso, Anna doesn\u2019t have asthma and allergies. Life makes me sneeze. Kitty litter, dogs, dust, feather pillows, down comforters, down coats, tomatoes, shellfish, milk, and cheese all give me fits. But although I\u2019ve had a couple of serious asthma attacks (which got zapped by a quick trip to the emergency room), there\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna let that slow me down.\n\nI don\u2019t play the violin or the piano or the harmonica. I do my best playing with my feet. Soccer is my game, but I also like running, skiing, basketball, and softball. I love sports. Back on Long Island, where we used to live, I was the star forward, leading scorer, and co\u2011captain of the soccer team.\n\nI\u2019m not bragging. In my opinion, the only people who brag are the ones who aren\u2019t first chair, if you know what I mean.\n\n\u201cHow was band practice?\u201d I asked Anna as I jogged up to her. I waved good\u2011bye to my teammates on the SMS soccer team and fell into step beside my sister.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the orchestra, not the band, and you know it,\u201d said Anna, smiling at me.\n\n\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to do violins to your feelings,\u201d I replied, making an awful pun on the word violence.\n\nMy sister groaned.\n\n\u201cSorry. That was viol,\u201d I couldn\u2019t resist adding.\n\nI like puns, the worse the better. My sister tolerates them. Another difference between us.\n\n\u201cIf you make another vile pun, Abby, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, fiddle,\u201d I wisecracked and ducked as Anna took a swat at me. But she was grinning.\n\n\u201cPractice was fine,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat about yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d I said. \u201cI love April. Perfect soccer weather. Too bad we have to go to Bat Mitzvah class. I wish \u2026\u201d\n\nWait, wait, wait. I\u2019m doing what I always do. Going at top speed. And leaving you behind, right?",

          "text": "I\u2019m Abby Stevenson. I\u2019m thirteen years old and I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, with my only sibling, Anna, and our mother, Rachel. We moved here from Long Island not too long ago, after our mother got this great promotion at her publishing house in New York City. The promotion allowed my mother to buy a bigger house, and since she felt the family needed a change, we moved to Stoneybrook.\n\nNeither Anna nor I was delighted with the Big Move. Although we didn\u2019t talk about it, I know we both felt that there had been enough changes in the past few years. We didn\u2019t want to leave the house where our father had lived with us, either. He was killed in a car crash when we were nine.\n\nThat was the worst time in my life. The driver of the truck who hit our father\u2019s car only broke his arm, but our father was killed instantly. For a long time, my mother wouldn\u2019t even mention his name. For a long time, I forgot how to laugh and I couldn\u2019t make jokes.\n\nFor a long time \u2026 no, I don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore.\n\nAnyway, we complained, we resisted, and then what did we do? We moved, of course. My mother liked her new job. My twin sister joined the band \u2014 excuse me, the orchestra \u2014 at school and started making some friends. We were both invited to join this club called the Baby\u2011sitters Club (also known as the BSC, more about that later). Anna decided to stick to her music.\n\nI joined the club.\n\nThe members of the club became my friends, and provided not only friendship but some pretty wild adventures and baby\u2011sitting jobs that brought in very welcome extra money. I also joined the soccer team, participated in class, and avoided any major asthma attacks, except for one that sent me to the emergency room and almost canceled my membership in the BSC (but that\u2019s another story).",

I started liking Stoneybrook for real.\n\nAnd then the Bat Mitzvah (pronounced Baht Mitz\u2011vah) business creeps up and bites me on the ankle.\n\nOkay, okay, a Bat Mitzvah can\u2019t bite you on the ankle. Becoming a Bat Mitzvah is very special. It is the day when a Jewish girl celebrates her entry into adulthood, usually shortly after she turns thirteen. It is an extremely important, wonderful celebration (Jewish boys have a Bar Mitzvah).\n\nBut becoming a Bat Mitzvah involves a ton of work. At least one year in advance you have to start taking lessons to prepare you for the Shabbat when you become a Bat Mitzvah. (Shabbat is the holy day of the week for Jewish people, from Friday at sundown to Saturday at sundown.) To become a Bat Mitzvah, you have to read a portion of the Torah, which is the first five books of the Bible written in Hebrew. The Torah contains stories, laws, and history of the Jewish people.\n\nHebrew. This is a language I am studying (not very well) to become a Bat Mitzvah. That is one of the reasons it takes so much work to become a Bat Mitzvah. I have to sing (yikes!) another part of the service, the Haftarah, a reading after the Torah.\n\nSo you read (actually you chant more than sing, in Hebrew). And then in my synagogue, you also have to give a speech (which the rabbi keeps callin",

(That, by the way, is a fancy term for \u201cnot born yet.\u201d) You see, my aunt was faxing us her baby\u2019s latest sonogram.\n\nHave you ever seen a sonogram? It\u2019s a picture taken with sound waves. (I don\u2019t know how they do it. Maybe they sing through the camera.) Cool, huh?\n\nSort of. I mean, I can understand why you\u2019d want to have a picture of your baby in utero. But let me be frank. If I ever found a sonogram of me taken before I was born, I\u2019d burn it.\n\nFirst of all, the quality stinks. My little cousin\u2011to\u2011be's sonogram was scratchy and dark, with absolutely no contrast. I couldn\u2019t help picturing it in a Highlights magazine, under the heading, \u201cCan You Find the Hidden Baby?\u201d\n\nSecond, the proportions were all off. She reminded me of the wizard\u2019s big head in The Wizard of Oz.\n\nNot to mention that she was naked and sleeping. I mean, puh\u2011leeze. No privacy whatsoever.\n\nDespite all that, I could hardly keep from crying. Before this baby, my aunt had been through a miscarriage, so we were all a little worried, although we\u2019d tried not to dwell on that too much. Now, after all these months, and all of our dreams and fantasies, we were actually seeing a real, live, almost\u2011born baby. I was so filled with emotion I wanted to burst.",

Forget about holding back tears.\n\nAt the mention of Mimi\u2019s name, my eyes were like Niagara Falls.\n\nMimi was my grandmother. She was also my favorite person in the whole world. Boy, did I wish she were still alive. She would have been so proud, looking at her new granddaughter.\n\n\u201cHow about \u2026 Mimi?\u201d I suggested, sniffling.\n\nMom put her arm around my shoulder. Her eyes were pretty misty, too. \u201cThat is a beautiful choice for a name.\u201d\n\nLittle Mimi. The name fit. Our family had lost one member; now we were gaining a new one. Whenever I thought of Mimi, I felt a hole deep inside me. Now, in a funny way, I could feel it starting to fill.\n\nWould my aunt choose that name, too? I hoped so. Mimi was her mom, after all.\n\nBut you never knew. Especially with an aunt whose own name is Peaches.\n\nYes, Peaches.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a nickname. Her real name is Miyoshi. My mom\u2019s name is Rioko. We\u2019re Japanese\u2011Americans. Mimi was Japanese\u2011Japanese. Which explains the traditional names in my mom\u2019s generation and the more Americanized names in mine.\n\nPeaches is a special case. She\u2019s a lot younger than my mom, for one thing. Plus she\u2019s wild and wacky, which makes her a real oddball in the Kishi family.",

But when it comes to fun? Well, let\u2019s just say they\u2019re \u2014 relaxationally challenged.\n\nMy dad\u2019s idea of a good time is doing the crossword puzzle in the Sunday New York Times. He\u2019s a partner in an investment firm, and his eyes light up when he talks about stocks and bonds (which to me sound like old\u2011fashioned torture instruments). My mom\u2019s a librarian. She believes I should read only classic literature, so I have to hide my Nancy Drew books (which I love and she hates).\n\nIn my parents\u2019 eyes, Janine is perfection. She finishes my dad's puzzles after he gives up. She not only likes classical books, but classical music and classical clothes. That day, for example, she was wearing a prim, button\u2011down white shirt with a pin in the shape of a profile of Bach.\n\nWhoever that is.\n\nJanine\u2019s in high school, but she\u2019s smarter than some of the teachers, so she takes classes at the local university (in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where we live). She studies subjects such as calculus and physics.\n\nMe? I thought physics was the study of how to put bubbles in soda. (Say it aloud and you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about.) I\u2019m also allergic to spelling and crossword puzzles. My grades, as you can guess, are pretty rotten.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy being Janine\u2019s younger sister. At the beginning of every school year, my teachers all think I\u2019m acting stupid on purpose. Then, when they realize I\u2019m not an academic genius, they take weeks to recover from the disappointment.\n\nExcept my art teachers. They adore me. I am absolutely passionate about art. I love to sculpt, paint, draw, and make jewelry. I look at everything with an artist\u2019s eye: in terms of light, color, and texture. I collect all kinds of stuff, materials to use in collages and interesting clothes from thrift shops and yard sales. Once, when I was wearing a really wild outfit, my friend Abby Stevenson told me I use my body as a canvas.\n\nI thought that was hilarious. I repeated it to my family over dinner. My mom smiled politely, Janine shrugged, and my dad became very grim. He thought it was an insult.\n\nHonestly, sometimes I think I was switched with another baby at birth.\n\nJust sometimes. Mimi understood my artistic side. And Peaches\u2019 sense of humor is a lot like mine. I think I inherited her genes.\n\nAnd you know what? Little Mimi was going to inherit them, too. I just knew it.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Dad said, turning away from the fax machine, \u201cwhat a terrific way to start the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I keep this?\u201d I asked, holding up the fax paper.\n\n\u201cMaybe you can colorize it,\u201d Janine suggested with a smile. \u201cLike those old movies.\u201d",

We gabbed as we waited for Richard to fetch the car. Then we gabbed during the entire ride home. Mary Anne told me all about our friend Claudia Kishi\u2019s new baby cousin. I told everyone the news about Sunny\u2019s mom. It was all stuff we\u2019d discussed over the phone, but it felt wonderful saying it person\u2011to\u2011person.\n\nAs for Jeff, he was busy exchanging bad jokes with Richard.

Around me, everything was totally wrong. The carpet was missing. My surfboard was gone.\n\nFor someone whose name is Dawn, Jeff remarked, \u201cyou sure don\u2019t live up to it.\u201d\n\n\"Earth to Dawn.\"\n\nThe fog in my brain was slowly lifting. I was in Stoneybrook. It was Monday morning, my first weekday of the summer vacation!\n\n\"Why do I always have to wake you up for breakfast?\" Jeff asked. \"Richard won\u2019t serve unless we\u2019re all down there.\"\n\nI sat up. My eyelids felt as if they weighed thirty pounds each. \"Okay, give me two minutes.\"\n\nJeff nodded sternly. \"Two. Not twenty\u2011two. I have things to do today.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\nAs he left, I wobbled out of bed. My trusty desk clock read eight\u2011fifteen A.M., which meant my California\u2011tuned body thought it was five\u2011fifteen.\n\nI looked into my closet door mirror and almost fainted. My hair was like a mass of tangled wires. My face was so droopy it looked as if someone were standing below me with a flesh magnet.\n\nWhat time had Mary Anne and I said good night? I couldn\u2019t remember. But I did recall looking at the clock around midnight or so.\n\nI slapped my cheeks. (That\u2019s a trick Carol taught me. It puts color back in them.) Then, as I yanked a brush through my hair, images of the previous night flooded into my sleep\u2011deprived brain.\n\nAs soon as we had arrived home from the airport, Richard had ordered from my favorite pizza place. We\u2019d all sat around the table, talking about the summer. Jeff had been so excited, he\u2019d forgotten to tell jokes for a while. He\u2019d asked about all his friends and had even run around in the backyard by himself awhile, just \u201cto get connected.\u201d He was actually cute.\n\nNow, the morning after, I was feeling a little disconnected myself. I breathed in the familiar musty scent of my old room. Boy, did it feel great to be back. A warm, slightly humid breeze floated through the window, sweet with honeysuckle.\n\nMustiness. Humidity. Honeysuckle.\n\nAll of it was so un\u2011California. So East Coast.\n\nSo \u2026 fantastic!\n\nWhat were our plans for this glorious summer? Oh, a little bit of nothing and a lot of fun. Hanging out, going to the beach, seeing movies, and baby\u2011sitting.\n\nYes, I was even looking forward to baby\u2011sitting. I missed all my old Stoneybrook charges. But I also missed the BSC.\n\nI wasn\u2019t going to have to miss it for very long, though. The next meeting was to begin at 5:30 sharp.\n\nWhich, since I couldn\u2019t shake off that dream on the plane, still gave me approximately nine hours and fifteen minutes to worry.\n\n\"It\u2019s been two minutes!\" Jeff called from downstairs.\n\nOops. Nine hours and thirteen minutes.\n\nI threw on some clothes and ran down to the kitchen. The smell was so wonderful I thought I\u2019d die.\n\nMy stepdad was standing over the stove, an apron around his belly and a proud smile on his face. \"Richard Spier\u2019s patented egg\u2011white Spanish om",

He\u2019d just bitten into a tuna sandwich on a roll, but he smiled at me with his eyes. I returned his smile.\n\nWe had spent the whole morning together playing tennis. (He\u2019d won three games and I\u2019d won three.) Then we\u2019d biked to the deli and brought back lunch, which we were now eating as we sat on a green bench by the outdoor courts. It was perfect end\u2011of\u2011summer weather, warm but with a cool breeze. The day had been so much fun. I wanted it to go on \u2014 undisturbed by Andi Gentile \u2014 forever.\n\nRobert hadn\u2019t yet noticed Andi Gentile approaching. He was looking at me. Maybe if I pretended I didn\u2019t see her he wouldn\u2019t notice her, either. Maybe she\u2019d just keep walking.\n\nI swiveled around and acted fascinated by a tennis game at one of the courts behind us. (And I do mean acted. The two people playing were moving at a snail\u2019s pace.) \u201cLook, Robert,\u201d I said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that guy have a great serve?\u201d",

          "text": "I guess,\u201d Robert said, eyeing the game skeptically. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of slow motion.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, guys,\u201d Andi exclaimed.\n\nNo luck.\n\n\u201cOh, hi, Andi,\u201d I replied with casual friendliness as I turned away from the slowest game of tennis on earth.\n\n\u201cAndi! Hi!\u201d Robert said, quickly wiping at his mouth with a white deli napkin. He swallowed his tuna in one big gulp. \u201cHow are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she replied, rocking on the soles of her gleaming white sneakers and casually swinging her chrome tennis racket.\n\nI didn\u2019t like the way he was smiling at Andi. Calm down, Stacey, I ordered myself. There was no reason to worry about Andi. Robert and Andi were just friends.\n\nI\u2019m meeting Sheila here for tennis,\u201d Andi informed us as if that were great news.\n\nNot Sheila MacGregor, too! I thought. Of all the girls who hang around with Robert\u2019s old crowd of friends, Andi and Sheila are not the worst. Not by far. I even sort of like Andi. But I wasn\u2019t in the mood to hang out with them today. I didn\u2019t want them spoiling this time with Robert.\n\nYou see, lately Robert has been spending less and less time with his old crowd and I want it to stay that way. Those kids have caused me so much grief, you wouldn\u2019t believe it. They almost got me in trouble for shoplifting, and I even stopped hanging around with my real friends because of them.\n\nSure, they\u2019re popular kids and all, but I think their values are the pits. They\u2019re not what I\u2019d call true friends at all.\n\nBelieve me, I know what real friends are because I have them. Seven of them to be exact. Kristy, Mary Anne, Abby, Claudia (my very best friend), Mallory, Jessi, and Dawn. (Even though Dawn has moved to California, she\u2019s still a friend.) When you add me \u2014 Stacey McGill \u2014 we make up eight devoted friends who would do anything for one another. We\u2019re even in a club together, the Baby\u2011sitters Club. I\u2019ll tell you more about that later.\n\nFor now, though, let me get back to the story of my ruined summer day. (Well, almost ruined, anyway.)\n\nI definitely did not like the way Robert was smiling at Andi. Not that Robert isn\u2019t allowed to smile at other people. That would be ridiculous. But it was the way he was smiling that bothered me. He was smiling with his eyes and his mouth, smiling as though he were really glad to be talking to Andi.\n\nAndi was telling Robert this supposedly funny story about how a friend of theirs, Jacqui Grant, got caught going from movie to movie at the quadraplex in the Washington Mall. I know it\u2019s not the worst crime on earth, but still, those kids are always doing things like that. They\u2019re always getting into trouble and they seem to think it\u2019s funny.\n\nApparently Andi thought this story about Jacqui was hysterical. She was nearly breathless with laughter. \u201cAnd then \u2026 and then \u2026\u201d she gasped, struggling to speak through all her laughing. \u201cWhen the usher wasn\u2019t looking, she ducked into the Disney movie and had to crawl down the aisle to get away from him.\u201d\n\nRobert roared with laughter at this. \u201cI can just picture her crawling around in the dark,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know! I know!\u201d Andi laughed, putting her hand on Robert\u2019s shoulder as if she were laughing so hard she needed him to hold her up. \u201cGuess how she got caught? She got her foot stuck between two seats. When the usher came after her she was sprawled in the middle of the aisle. Helpless! She couldn\u2019t even move! She just looked up at him and said, \u2018I seem to be stuck.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat really set them off. Even I had to smile, not because I thought it was so funny but because their laughter was contagious.\n\nThey were doubled over with hysterics, and I was so distracted by them that we didn\u2019t notice Sheila until she was right in front of us.",

She tossed back her silky, thick blonde hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling Robert and Stacey what happened to Jacqui,\u201d Andi replied, panting.\n\n\u201cOh, isn\u2019t that hysterical?\u201d Sheila laughed.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Andi said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we play doubles?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, why not?\u201d Robert agreed, scooping his racket up off the bench.\n\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d I said, my voice overlapping Robert\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ve already played six games. I\u2019m pretty pooped.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s right,\u201d Sheila said with sickly sweet sympathy. \u201cYour illness and all.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI\u2019m just tired.\u201d Sheila was referring to the fact that I\u2019m diabetic, which means my body has trouble controlling the sugar levels in my bloodstream. Diabetes is a serious disease but I can live a normal life as long as I give myself injections of insulin every day and stick to a strict, healthy diet. (No sweets. Or my system would go wild and I could even go into a coma.) There\u2019s no doubt that having diabetes is a major drag, but I let it stop me from doing anything ",

          "text": "When I\u2019d finally staggered downstairs on Sunday morning, I\u2019d found three messages from Mary Anne on the answering machine. Message one was a cheerful \u201cCall me when you\u2019re home.\u201d Message two sounded a little concerned.\n\nBy message three, I could tell she was fighting back tears. Thinking we were kidnapped. Imagining we\u2019d decided to move to Hawaii. (Actually, that doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea\u2026.)\n\nMary Anne is a real worrywart. Not to mention shynesswart and politenesswart. The teeniest things can make her cry, too \u2014 movies, books, you name it. Whisper the words \u201cOld Yeller\u201d to her and watch her eyes well up. Usually I have no patience for people like that. I\u2019m the opposite \u2014 tearless and fearless, loud and proud. But I\u2019ve known Mary Anne since we were babies, and she happens to be my best friend in the world.\n\nAs you may have guessed, I have a forceful personality. My friends say I\u2019m bossy and stubborn, but don\u2019t listen to them. They\u2019re all members of the Baby\u2011sitters Club (more about that later), and I\u2019m their president, so bossiness is just part of the deal. Period.\n\nHere are the other vital facts about me: I\u2019m thirteen years old and just barely five feet tall. I have brown hair and brown eyes, and I\u2019m very athletic. I wear casual clothes all the time, and I think fashion is boring.\n\nOkay. Enough about me. Back to Mary Anne.\n\nI was dying to talk to her. Half of me wanted to ask how the club had survived. The other half wanted to gab about Hawaii. Mary Anne had been there on a school trip in July, along with almost all of my other BSC (Baby\u2011sitters Club) friends.\n\n\u201cSorry about the noise, Mary Anne,\u201d I shouted into the phone as Emily Michelle zipped by. \u201cEmily, go to Nannie!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re home,\u201d Mary Anne replied. \u201cI have been sooo lonely, and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starving!\u201d announced my middle brother, Sam, stomping toward the kitchen. \u201cYo, Blabberlips, when are you going to be off the phone?\u201d\n\nSam\u2019s fifteen, but sometimes he has the maturity of a toddler. (Why am I the only Thomas kid who acts her age?) Ignoring his obnoxious comment, I pressed the receiver to my ear and tried to listen.\n\n\u201cHouse of Wiley?\u201d asked Mary Anne. (That\u2019s what it sounded like. It was hard to tell over the noise.)\n\n\u201cWhaaat?\u201d I asked.\n\nSam rolled his eyes. \u201cI said, when are you going to be off the phone?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow \u2026 was \u2026 Hawaii?\u201d Mary Anne said loudly.\n\nBefore I could answer either of them, Sam pulled open the fridge, releasing a blast of putrid air. I nearly gagged.\n\n\u201cYeccch, it stinks!\u201d I blurted out.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Mary Anne said. \u201cI think it\u2019s magical.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not Hawaii! Our fridge!\u201d\n\nSam slammed the door shut. \u201cWhat died in there?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone died?\u201d Mary Anne asked.\n\nI held my nose. \u201cDoe! Just sub boldy food.\u201d\n\n(Take some advice from me, Kristy Thomas. If you\u2019re going on vacation, don\u2019t ever leave an open bowl of tuna salad in your fridge.)\n\nCharlie clomped into the kitchen and glared at me. \u201cTalk fast. I want to call Sarah.\u201d (That\u2019s his girlfriend.)\n\n\u201cHey, me first!\u201d Sam insisted.\n\n\u201cWho are you calling?\u201d Charlie demanded.\n\n\u201cNone of your business!\u201d Sam snapped.\n\n\u201cUh, Kristy,\u201d Mary Anne asked patiently, \u201cis this a bad time to talk?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d I walked toward the kitchen archway, away from the stench and the argument. \u201cMary Anne, I actually tried to surf. You should have seen me. You will die when I show you the pictures.\u201d\n\nCharlie and Sam were arguing at the top of their lungs. Nannie was chasing after Emily Michelle with a change of clothes. David Michael came in and pretended to faint from the smell. Mom bustled in and yelled at Charlie and Sam for not cleaning the fridge.\n\n\u201cGuys, will you please be quiet?\u201d I yelled.\n\nHonestly, you\u2019d think it would be easy to find peace and quiet in a mansion. But nooooo. Everyone just had to be in the same room as Kristy.\n\nYes, you heard right. Mansion. With fancy wallpaper, high ceilings, lots of wood trim everywhere, and a big yard. Cool, huh?\n\nDon\u2019t think I\u2019m a rich snob or anything. I\u2019m casual, down\u2011to\u2011earth, and friendly as can be. (Modest, too. Heh heh.) Actually, I was not born into wealth. I grew up in a small house across town, next door to Mary Anne. My mom raised Charlie, Sam, David Michael, and me w",

          "text": "\u201cUsing your protractor,\u201d I read aloud, \u201cmeasure each angle.\u201d I picked up the protractor and glared at it. It had such a friendly rainbow shape, but it wasn\u2019t friendly at all. It was a hated enemy. Why? Because I didn\u2019t have the slightest idea of how to use it.\n\nMy teacher had gone over it, more than once. And there were even some directions in the math textbook on the desk in front of me. But I couldn\u2019t remember my teacher\u2019s directions, and the author of my textbook clearly doesn\u2019t speak English \u2014 at least, not the same English I speak. She speaks very good math, but that\u2019s definitely a foreign language to me.\n\nI\u2019m Claudia Kishi, and I\u2019m thirteen and in the eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School, which is in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. You\u2019d think that being in the eighth grade would mean I am capable of doing eighth-grade math, but so far that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. It\u2019s October, and school\u2019s only been in session for a little over a month now. What I want to know is, how did I already become so hopelessly behind?\n\nIt\u2019s not just math, either. I feel lost in all my subjects. I\u2019m being buried by earth science. I\u2019m history in social studies, in which we\u2019re studying everything between the Civil War and now. And English? It might as well be Greek.\n\nBut you know what? This situation is really nothing new, nothing I can\u2019t handle. I\u2019ve never been a star student, to put it mildly. My spelling is atrocious, I have the worst case of math anxiety in SMS history, and my attention span is about as long as a five-year-old\u2019s \u2014 unless the subject happens to interest me.\n\nHere, in case you\u2019re wondering, are the subjects that interest me: arts and crafts of all kinds, kids, junk food, mysteries. Interesting list, isn\u2019t it? Notice how vocabulary building doesn\u2019t show up on it? Or protractor usage?\n\nSchool just isn\u2019t my thing. Art is, and so is baby-sitting. (I belong to this outrageously great club called the BSC, or Baby-sitters Club, but more about that later.) And I\u2019m basically addicted to any kind of junk food \u2014 whether from the salty, greasy, sugary, or chewy food groups \u2014 and to Nancy Drew books. My parents don\u2019t approve of Twinkies or mysteries, so I keep my supplies of both pretty well hidden.\n\nIn fact, I was just reaching for a Yodel (I\u2019d hidden a package of them behind the thesaurus my parents gave me for Christmas last year) when the phone rang. My phone, that is. I have my own private line, which is way cool.",

          "text": "\"Hello?\" I answered it.\n\n\"So, what are you wearing?\"\n\nIt was my best friend, Stacey McGill, and her question didn\u2019t strike me as odd at all. What we\u2019re wearing happens to be one of our favorite topics of conversation.\n\nNot that we\u2019re shallow. We\u2019re interested in lots of stuff besides our appearance. But we both love clothes and jewelry and accessories. For me, they\u2019re just another outlet for my creativity. I see my body as sort of a blank canvas, a moving work of art.\n\nStacey, on the other hand, is coming from another place. Manhattan, to be exact. She\u2019s into clothes because \u2014 well, because she was brought up on an island where all the natives dress to kill, every day. I mean, have you ever walked down Madison Avenue at lunch hour? The sidewalk looks like a feature in Vogue magazine. It\u2019s filled with women who look like models, all wearing the very latest couture. That\u2019s where Stacey \u2014 who could be mistaken for a model herself, with her long curly blonde hair and blue eyes \u2014 is coming from. Her style is a lot more sophisticated than mine; mine is much funkier and artier than hers. We\u2019re perfect shopping buddies because we rarely dive for the same item. She\u2019ll be going gaga for some navy blue, Chanel-style blazer while I\u2019m raving over a faded denim jacket with sixties-style embroidery on it.\n\nAnyway, I wasn\u2019t fazed by her question. Though I have to admit, I was a little bewildered. After all, we\u2019d seen each other at school only an hour or so ago. \"I\u2019m wearing the same thing I was wearing all day,\" I said, looking into the mirror as I spoke. \"You know, my tie-dye leggings, black overall shorts, red high-tops \u2014\"\n\n\"I didn\u2019t mean what are you wearing now,\" Stacey interrupted me. \"I knew that. And by the way, you looked totally cool today. What I meant was, what are you wearing to the dance?\"\n\n\"Dance?\" I asked.\n\n\"The Halloween Dance,\" she explained. \"You know, the one they announced this morning.\"\n\n\"Oh, right!\" How could I have forgotten? The announcement had been made during homeroom, while I was in the middle of trying desperately to finish homework for three different classes. I guess my mind had been elsewhere. \"Good question,\" I said. \"We\u2019ll have to come up with some awesome costumes. Do you have any ideas?\"\n\n\"I was thinking about going as a flapper,\" said Stacey. \"You know, one of those old-fashioned girls with the long beaded dresses?\"\n\n\"Sounds cool,\" I said. \"I haven\u2019t thought about it at all yet. I\u2019m too busy trying to figure out how to use this stupid protractor.\" I picked it up and made a face at it.\n\n\"Oh, that\u2019s a snap!\" said Stacey. \"I can explain it in about two seconds, if you\u2019ll listen closely.\"\n\n\"Uh, that\u2019s okay,\" I said. I\u2019ve been there before. Stacey is a straight-A student in math; in fact, I think she\u2019s already taking some advanced course like trigonometry. It comes naturally to her, and she thinks it\u2019s really easy. That\u2019s why her explanations never work for me. I don\u2019t think she has any idea how little I understand. For example, I\u2019m still not exactly clear on what an angle is, or what it\u2019s for, or why I need to measure it in the first place. I could never explain that to Stacey. She\u2019d be rushing on to tell me how to find the square root of the isosceles or something.\n\n\"I think I hear Janine, down in the kitchen,\" I said. \"I can ask her.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said Stacey. \"Whatever. I guess I\u2019ll see you at the meeting later, right? We can talk some more about our costumes then.\"\n\n\"Great,\" I replied. \"See you!\" I was glad she didn\u2019t seem hurt by my putting her off. It\u2019s just that",

I fake a handoff to Hannie, Linny flags right, and David Michael does a quick button hook. Okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight!\u201d shouted Kristy Thomas.\n\n\u201cYyyes!\u201d cried Linny Papadakis.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Hannie Papadakis.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a button hook?\u201d asked David Michael Thomas.\n\nGood question, I thought.\n\nI didn\u2019t really hear the answer, although I know it had something to do with running and catching. To tell you the truth, the moment Logan started explaining, my attention snapped back to the novel I was reading, Catherine, Called Birdy.\n\nWe were spending a Sunday morning at Kristy\u2019s house. Who are \u201cwe\u201d? Well, I\u2019m Mary Anne Spier. Kristy is my all-time best friend, and Logan is my boyfriend. I love them dearly, but as soon as they\u2019d started playing football with Kristy\u2019s little brother and the two Papadakis kids, I\u2019d excused myself.\n\nSitting against a maple tree with my novel, bundled in my wool jacket, I was perfectly happy. I figured I\u2019d read a few chapters before my stepmom picked me up. She was late, but that\u2019s sort of her style.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s weird to be reading outdoors on a chilly November day? I don\u2019t. I just love books. Besides, I had no other choice. Playing football is bad enough. Playing with Logan is downright frightening. He happens to be on the Stoneybrook Middle School football team, and he throws extremely hard.\n\nKristy doesn\u2019t mind. She\u2019s a great athlete. The kids don\u2019t mind either, because they think Logan\u2019s a superstar. He does throw very gently to them. (David Michael and Hannie are seven, and Linny\u2019s nine.)\n\nI\u2019ve tried playing. Logan has explained the rules to me a million times. Kristy insists that it\u2019s easy and fun. But it\u2019s not. The moment I see a football headed in my direction, I can think of only one thing to do.\n\nDuck.\n\nSo, on fall weekends, I always carry a paperback with me. It comes in handy whenever pigskin fever strikes.\n\nPigskin fever seemed to have struck my hometown, Stoneybrook, Connecticut. The SMS Chargers were undefeated. Logan told me they were \u201cassured of a playoff berth.\u201d At first I thought he meant \u201cbirth\u201d and I was totally confused. But he explained that the team was going to be in the district championships, which apparently is a very nice thing.\n\nWhy is someone like me attracted to such athletic people? I have no idea. My dad says I take after him. He\u2019s terrible at sports, too, but his best friends at his law firm are athletic. In fact, Dad once told me that my mom played on her college basketball team.",

As much as I love my stepmom, I call her by her first name, Sharon.\n\nIf a genie appeared and granted me one wish, you know what it would be? To go into the past and meet my mother. You see, she died when I was a baby. Do you think it\u2019s possible to miss someone you don\u2019t remember? I do. My dad doesn\u2019t talk about her much, but I know he was devastated when she died \u2014 so devastated that he had to let my grandparents take care of me while he grieved.\n\nWhen Dad took me back, he felt kind of overwhelmed by single parenthood. He decided to be Mr. Strict. I had to wear super\u2011conservative clothes and keep my hair in pigtails right through seventh grade. I had to go to bed earlier than some nine\u2011year\u2011olds I knew.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, things have changed. I\u2019m in eighth grade now. I have a reasonable curfew, and no, I do not look like Pippi Longstocking anymore. Dad finally realized I was growing up. He\u2019s been a lot happier himself, too, especially after meeting Sharon.\n\nActually, meeting isn\u2019t the right word. Remeeting is more like it. Dad and Sharon were sweethearts at Stoneybrook High School. They broke up, though because Sharon\u2019s parents looked down their noses at my dad. (Hmmph.) Sharon went off to California, taking Dad\u2019s heart with her. Well, temporarily. He did meet my mom soon after. Anyway, Dad and Sharon completely lost touch. (Now, if this were a movie, you\u2019d see the words Many years later \u2026 on the screen.) Cut to my seventh\u2011grade year. I made friends with a girl named Dawn Schafer who had just moved to Stoneybrook from California, with her younger brother and her divorced mom. (Suspenseful music here.) It took us awhile to realize her mom was the Sharon in Dad\u2019s romantic past.\n\nHave you ever seen Fiddler on the Roof? In it, this character named Yente is constantly trying to match couples in marriage. Well, Dawn and I were double Yentes. Dad and Sharon didn\u2019t have a chance. Before long, wedding bells were ringing. Suddenly I had a great stepmom, a great stepsister, and a great new house (Dad and I moved into Sharon\u2019s two\u2011hundred\u2011year\u2011old farmhouse).\n\nUnfortunately, Dawn doesn\u2019t live there anymore. At least not full\u2011time. She moved back to California to live with her dad. (Her younger brother, Jeff, had done the same thing earlier on.) It wasn\u2019t that they hated Stoneybrook or anything. They were just terribly homesick.\n\nI miss Dawn so much. But I don\u2019t want to dwell on that. I\u2019ll just cry.\n\nThat\u2019s another thing you should know about me. I cry a lot. I cry when I\u2019m happy and when I\u2019m upset. Sad movies are the worst. Last Christmas I invited Kristy over to watch It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, and she brought along an umbrella. Logan says I have an obscure condition called Spier\u2019s Tears.\n\nAside from the crying, I\u2019m a pretty average person, I guess. I\u2019m just over five feet tall. I have short brown hair and brown eyes. My friends call my wardrobe \u201cpreppy,\u201d but I think of it as neat and not too flashy. They also call me shy and sensitive, but I think that\u2019s because I happen to enjoy listening to people.\n\nI looked at my watch and did a double take. It was almost noon. Sharon was supposed to have picked me up at eleven. As I mentioned, she\u2019s not exactly the promptest person in the world, but this was unusual.\"",

We\u2019re only six in number \u2014 Daddy, Mama, Aunt Cecelia, Becca, Squirt, and me (Jessi) \u2014 but we make the noise of a hundred. Sometimes Daddy calls us the Circus Ramseycus.\n\nFrom the living room, Aunt Cecelia called out, \u201cI\u2019ll be in there to see how clean those dishes are in a minute!\u201d\n\nDaddy rolled his eyes.\n\nDaddy loves to tease Aunt Cecelia, and she likes to scold him. They\u2019ve been like that all their lives. They\u2019re brother and sister, but you\u2019d never believe it from looking at them. Daddy kind of reminds me of a prince in a fairy tale. He\u2019s tall and handsome, with a great sense of humor and a beautiful, deep voice. Aunt Cecelia\u2019s not naturally thin. She has a scratchy voice and she hardly ever cracks a smile. In a fairy tale, she\u2019d probably be the witch. I love her dearly, but she can be hard to live with.\n\nAunt Cecelia claims she\u2019s younger than Daddy, but the only one who believes her is my little sister. (Becca\u2019s eight years old, so she\u2019s easily fooled.) I, Jessica Ramsey, am eleven, which is old enough to smell a fib.\n\n\u201cHe sees you when you\u2019re sweeping,\u201d Daddy sang as he swept. \u201cAnd buys you a new car \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDaaaaaddyyyy!\u201d Becca yelled.\n\nMama sighed. \u201cFor your father, life is \u2018Showtime at the Apollo.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d give him the hook!\u201d Aunt Cecelia called out.\n\nDaddy jutted out his jaw. \u201cYou all don\u2019t respect real talent.\u201d\n\nCrazy. What can I say?\n\nWell, we had an excuse for acting so silly. It was the first of December. The beginning of the absolute best month of the year.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I think the holidays are truly magical. The moment I see the first Christmas decorations in the store windows, I\u2019m a little kid again. I feed Christmas carol recordings into the CD player all day long. Thinking about presents, I\u2019m weak in the knees. And when I look forward to a whole week of Kwanzaa, my eyes water. Honest.\n\nThe entire month of December I\u2019m one big tingle.\n\n\u201cYvonne called today,\u201d Mama said to Daddy. \u201cShe was wondering what our plans were for the holidays.\u201d\n\nI nearly dropped a plate. Yvonne is my aunt. Her daughter, Keisha, is my all-time favorite cousin. We grew up together in Oakley, New Jersey, before my branch of the family moved to Stoneybrook. \u201cCan they come over for Christmas?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYaaaaaay!\u201d Becca shouted from the family room.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re spending Christmas at home,\u201d Mama replied, \u201cbut they\u2019d love to get together for Kwanzaa \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCan they?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh, please please please please?\u201d\n\nBecca rushed in, clutching an enormous department store catalog. \u201cPleeeeeeeease?\u201d\n\nDaddy laughed. \u201cAs long as they bring some pecan pie, they\u2019re welcome in this house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we just have to figure out exactly when,\u201d Mama said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not planning to have them over for the entire week?\u201d Aunt Cecelia called out from the bathroom. \u201cThat\u2019s an awful lot of work.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Cecelia, don\u2019t be a Kwanzaa Grinch,\u201d Daddy said.\n\n\u201cBup! Bup! Bup!\u201d shouted Squirt, hopping into the kitchen.\n\n\u201cCould one of you change his diaper?\u201d Aunt Cecelia said wearily. \u201cI have got to clean my bedroom.\u201d\n\nDaddy went running after Squirt. \u201cMaybe not a week,\u201d he said over his shoulder. \u201cBut a couple of days, at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefinitely for the karamu feast,\u201d Mama agreed.\n\n\u201cYaaay!\u201d I did a little pirouette in front of the dishwasher. Liquid flung outward from the coffee mug I was holding.\n\n\u201cEwwwww!\u201d Becca cried out. \u201cGerms!\u201d\n\n\u201cJessi!\u201d Mama warned.\n\n\u201cOops.

          "text": "Taptaptaptap \u2026\n\nThat was the sound of my short nails impatiently drumming on my desk. I didn\u2019t even realize I was doing it until my science teacher, Mrs. Gonzalez, turned and scowled at me.\n\nYou know the look. One of those real Looks of Doom teachers must learn in college. \u201cDone with your test already, Ms. Stevenson?\u201d she asked skeptically.\n\n\u201cUh \u2026 yeah,\u201d I replied, taken by surprise. I\u2019d been in sort of another world, happily remembering a soccer game I\u2019d played in last year when I still lived on Long Island. I\u2019d been the high scorer in that game. You should have seen me.\n\nI\u2019d probably started tapping the desk while I was picturing myself anxiously waiting for Maggie Sweeney to pass me the ball. She was completely boxed in, surrounded by players from the other team, and I was right out in the open. Totally clear. What was taking her so long to figure it out? She had to know I was there. And then she did \u2014 pass the ball, that is. I slammed it right past the goalie. Score! Another point for Awesome Abby the Soccer Machine! \u201cYesss!\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you should use this extra time to check your answers,\u201d Mrs. Gonzalez suggested.\n\n\u201cOh \u2026 yeah \u2026 okay,\u201d I agreed, looking down at my test. I squinted, frowned, and acted concerned. Actually, though, I wasn\u2019t even reading the test questions. I\u2019m no science genius, but I\u2019d studied, and I happened to know these answers. What was I supposed to do, rip my hair out and start sweating, worrying whether they were right or not?\n\nGive me a break. Not my style.\n\nWhile I pretended to agonize over my answers, I tried to return to my memories of that glorious, victorious soccer game. But it was like trying to reenter a fantastic dream after waking up in the middle of the night \u2014 almost impossible to do.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s not that I live in the past a lot. Not at all. It\u2019s just that I was bored. Actually, I was Bored.\n\nIt was January. I hate January. Hate. Loathe. Despise. February, too. The time between the holidays and springtime has got to be the longest, draggiest, most awful time of year.\n\nIt\u2019s also the time of year when my dad died in a car accident, which is probably another reason I detest the season so much.\n\nThat was four years ago. There I was, this incredibly sad nine-year-old kid, staring out the window at the bare, winter trees, wondering how such a rotten thing could have happened.\n\nI remember that I didn\u2019t smile or even talk much after he died. Why bother? Then one day my best friend told me a joke, kind of a stupid joke, really. And I cracked up. Somehow, my laughter turned into tears. It was as though I were crying and laughing at the same time. Although it must have looked strange, it was actually a turning point. All the emotion I\u2019d kept bottled up inside poured out that day. After that, I began to heal. Slowly.\n\nLife went on, more or less. Of course, there was this gigantic hole in my life, where my father had been, but there wasn\u2019t anything I could do about it. The next big change came when my mother, my twin sister, Anna, and I moved here to Stoneybrook, Connecticut.\n\nAt first I was extremely bummed. I missed my Long Island friends. I thought I\u2019d never find kids as great in Stoneybrook.\n\nBut it turns out that some of the Stoneybrook kids are actually cool. I made friends fast enough. Joining the BSC helped a lot. (BSC stands for Baby-sitters Club. I\u2019ll fill you in on that later.)\n\nThe sound of static filled the air, which meant that an announcement was about to come over the PA system. My classmates and I looked up expectantly from our papers.\n\n\u201cEighth-grade classes have been canceled for the next two periods,\u201d said the distinctive voice of Mrs. Downey, the school secretary.\n\n\u201cAll right!\u201d I cheered.\n\nMrs. Gonzalez frowned.\n\n\u201cAll eighth-graders are to report to the gymnasium for health checks,\u201d Mrs. Downey went on. \u201cSeventh-graders will report during \u2026\u201d\n\nI stopped listening. Health checks? What was this about? I raised my hand and Mrs. Gonzalez nodded at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs there some plague going around or something?\u201d (Anna and I had watched a scary movie the night before. It was about a killer virus that almost wiped out the planet.)\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mrs. Gonzalez replied, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s just routine. Eye tests. Hearing. And a scoliosis check.\u201d\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cScoliosis check. For curvature of the spine.\u201d\n\nI relaxed and settled into my chair as Mrs. Gonzalez began collecting the test papers. I already knew my eyes aren\u2019t great. That\u2019s why I wear glasses or contact lenses (depending on how I feel). I hear fine, and I stand up straight. No problems there.\n\nIf they\u2019d been testing for allergies, that would have been a different story. Guess what I\u2019m allergic to. Go ahead. Almost anything you\u2019d answer would be correct. I\u2019m allergic to \u2026 everything!\n\nWell, not everything, but it seems that way sometimes. I\u2019m sure if I landed on Mars I\u2019d find some little Martian spore that would have me sniffling. The cosmos makes me sneeze.\n\nBesides that, I also have asthma. I carry two inhalers, a regular one and a prescription one for really bad attacks. It\u2019s a drag, but it could be worse, right? I don\u2019t let it stop me from doing anything. And anyway, I\u2019m stuck with it so there\u2019s no sense complaining.\n\nWhen science let out, I left the classroom and was swept up in the river of eighth-graders flowing down to the gym. I felt glad to be missing my boring health class and happy to let the crowd carry me along until I was inside the gym.\n\nTesting stations had been set up all around the gym. Teachers tried to create order, directing the kids into different lines, scolding them to keep the noise level down. At the different stations, people in white medical jackets had already begun the testing.\n\nCraning my neck above the heads of other kids, I searched for Anna. It was kind of like looking for myself, except not exactly. Although Anna and I are identical twins, we don\u2019t look completely the same. Anna\u2019s curly brown hair is short and mine is long.

They stood up at once, laughing and talking. Can you tell where I was?\n\nThe start of the circus? Halftime at a Stoneybrook Middle School football game?\n\nNo. The end of math class. Which also happens to be the end of the school day.\n\nMath and last period are two concepts that don\u2019t mix very well. Most of my classmates come in looking as if they\u2019re ready for a nap. They leave as if they\u2019ve been released from prison.\n\nMe? I don\u2019t mind math class. In fact, I think it\u2019s interesting and fun. I wish my teacher, Mr. Zizmore, would go a little faster. What I don\u2019t like is sitting around while he repeats things seventeen times for the class sleepyheads.\n\nWhich is why I\u2019d spent the last fifteen minutes writing an original book on looseleaf sheets hidden inside my textbook. It\u2019s called The Stacey McGill Guide to Third\u2011Grade Math. (Actually, I\u2019m in eighth grade, but I happened to be tutoring an eight\u2011year\u2011old girl named Lindsey DeWitt.)\n\nI slapped my textbook shut and stood up from my seat. Kids were chatting away. Mr. Zizmore was examining a note on a small pink slip.\n\n\u201cStacey?\u201d he called out. \u201cMs. Hartley would like to see you in Room two\u2011oh\u2011eight after school.\u201d\n\nMs. Hartley is the chairperson of the Stoneybrook Middle School math department. Why did she want to see me? I had no idea.\n\n\u201cOoooooh, bad girl \u2026\u201d murmured Irv Hirsch, the Stupid\u2011Prank King of SMS, who just happens to sit behind me.\n\nI ignored him. As I lifted the books off my desk, a sheet of my work\u2011in\u2011progress fell out. I tried to grab it, but Irv beat me to it.\n\n\u201cAttention, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d he said with a mock\u2011English accent, \u201cthe notes of the class genius! I quote: \u2018Subtraction of three\u2011digit numbers, those with numeral values in the hundreds, tens, and ones columns, must be arranged with the subtrahend below the minuend and answered from right to left.\u2019 Whoa, when did we learn this?\u201d\n\nI snatched the sheet away. \u201cIn third grade. Maybe you were absent that day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a minuend?\u201d\n\nI did not answer him. I marched out of the room and down the hall.",

She\u2019s allergic to just about anything you can think of \u2014 dust, pollen, shellfish, strawberries, dog fur, you name it.)\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s id by sciedce class. I could put a dissected frog in his backpack.\u201d\n\nI cracked up. It wasn\u2019t a bad idea.\n\nLeave it to Abby. She\u2019s the best remedy for a bad mood. Everything about her is funny. Take her hair. It\u2019s this thick brown curly mop. On that day, she\u2019d decided to gather it on the top of her head. It looked like an exploding volcano.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to make fun of her. Just the opposite. Here\u2019s the Stacey McGill Philosophy of Appearance, Rule One: If you feel confident on the inside, you look great on the outside, no matter what you wear. Abby doesn\u2019t care what people think about her appearance. I admire that.\n\nRule Number Two? If you can\u2019t be confident all the time, wear cool clothes. That\u2019s the rule I obey. For me, the hardest part of the day is deciding what to wear in the morning. My mom has to hide our mail\u2011order catalogs if she hopes to get a glimpse of them. Fashion is my passion. I can\u2019t help it. I like nice clothes the way some people like chocolate.\n\nActually, I can\u2019t even eat chocolate. I have this condition called diabetes. You\u2019ve heard of sugar shock? Well, diabetes is a mega\u2011case of that. My body can\u2019t store sugar and parcel it into my bloodstream a bit at a time, the way it\u2019s supposed to. Instead \u2014 wham! \u2014 the sugar goes right into the bloodstream. If I eat too much sugar, I could have serious problems, even pass out. But don\u2019t worry. Life without sweets is fine. To me, it\u2019s normal. As long as I eat meals on a strict schedule and give myself daily injections of a hormone called insulin (which is not as gross as it sounds), I lead a pretty normal life.\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject, here are some other things you need to know about me: I\u2019m thirteen years old. I have long, golden\u2011blonde hair. I grew up in New York City. My parents are divorced.\n\nMy parents were not divorced when we first moved to Stoneybrook, Connecticut. My dad\u2019s company had transferred him here from the Big Apple. It was hard to adjust to the suburbs, but I did \u2014 until Dad was transferred back. Zoom, off to the city again. I felt like a Ping\u2011Pong ball. Then my parents\u2019 marriage fell apart, and I had a choice: stay with Dad in New York or move with Mom to Stoneybrook.\n\nI, Stacey the City Girl, who can draw a map of the NYC subway system from memory, who wore out the sidewalks in front of my neighborhood boutiques, decided on Stoneybrook. Why? Three words. The Baby\u2011sitters Club. (Or is that four words? Whatever. It\u2019s a group of best friends, which I\u2019ll tell you about later.)\n\nAbby\u2019s a member of our group. She\u2019s also a New Yorker. Actually, a Long Islander, which is different than a Manhattanite, but I won\u2019t bore you with the details.\n\n\u201cWalk with be to by locker?\u201d Abby asked.\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to see Ms. Hartley after school.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs she givig you sub kide of bath award?\u201d\n\nI shrugged. (Bath award? For some reason, all I could think about was a bronze statuette in the shape of a rubber duckie.)",

Thank you, thank you.)\n\n\"The further you go down the line,\" I continued, \"the more things you have in common. Take us. We belong to the animal kingdom, but the class of mammals. We\u2019re in the same family as apes, I think. But species?

I memorized the first letters of all those classifications \u2014 K, P, C, O, F, G, S \u2014 because they also stand for Kindly Pass Claudia Oreos, For Goodness Sake.\n\nPretty cool system, huh? Take something hard and make it simple, that\u2019s my motto. Relate your schoolwork to the things you really love. I, Claudia Kishi, happen to love Oreos. (I also happen to love every other kind of junk food known to our species, but Twinkies didn\u2019t fit in this memory trick.)\n\nThe only problem with the Kishi Learning System is that it makes me hungry. Luckily, junk food is not the only thing I love. In fact, it ranks second to art. Painting, sculpting, drawing, jewelry\u2011making \u2014 I adore them all. In fact, I had tried to use artists\u2019 names to remember that long list \u2014 Kahlo, Picasso, C\u00e9zanne, O\u2019Keeffe, Frankenthaler, Gauguin, and Seurat \u2014 but that was much harder.\n\nStill, art helps me with all my other subjects. Social studies? I get to know historical characters by drawing them. Math? Well, I\u2019m still working that out. Attractive borders around my homework sometimes keep me from falling asleep. (It\u2019s a start.)\n\nAs you can see, because of my superior learning system and high grades, I am invited to the houses of my fellow students to help them with homework.\n\n(Yes, you may call with any questions related to the seventh\u2011grade curriculum. I have my own private phone, listed in the Stoneybrook, Connecticut, phone book.)\n\nOh. One other small thing. I\u2019m taking all my courses for the second time.\n\nWhy? Well, you see, I was born in the wrong year. I\u2019m like my uncle Russ, who says he was meant to live a hundred years ago, because in his soul, he\u2019s a pioneer in the Wild West.\n\nMe? I have the soul of a seventh\u2011grader in the body of an eighth\u2011grader.\n\nOkay, okay, I was sent back a grade. There. Now you know.\n\nI am thirteen years old. I started off in eighth grade, but I just couldn\u2019t hack it.\n\nTo be honest, hacking it has never been easy for me. It doesn\u2019t help that (a) my older sister, Janine, is a real genius, and (b) my parents have always expected me to be like her. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m stupid, it\u2019s just that I see the world as an artist sees it, not as a scholar does. Geometry may not be easy to me, but I can make a beautiful cubist painting.\n\nI felt devastated when I was told I had to repeat a grade. Destroyed. Humiliated. I wanted to curl up and die.\n\nBut so far, things seem to be turning out okay. My eighth\u2011grade friends have not abandoned me, and now I have a whole batch of great new friends in the seventh grade. Shira, Joanna, Josh, and Jeannie. Plus, for the first time in my life, I feel caught up in my studies.\n\nNot to mention the fact that my classmates actually think I\u2019m smart.\"",

I was ready to celebrate.\nSo was our puppy, Shannon. She jumped all over me, yipping happily.\nSitting around the kitchen table were Porky, Arnold, and Piglet. Actually, they were my three brothers \u2014 Charlie, Sam, and David Michael. At least I assumed they were. I couldn\u2019t see their faces. They were practically buried in a bowl of chips and pretzels.\nCharlie\u2019s seventeen, Sam\u2019s fifteen, and David Michael\u2019s seven. During snack time, though, they enter a time warp.

I could have been King Kong and they wouldn\u2019t have noticed me.\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t all say hello at once,\u201d I said, throwing the day\u2019s mail on the table.\nThe radio was blaring in the background. \u201cThis is Donnie Donaldson on WSTO, bringing you a beeeeootiful spring day in Stoneybrook, Connecticut.

Yuck.\u201d\nI ignored the comment. I love my brother, but he has no taste in music. Blade is my new all-time favorite rock group. They are the coolest. Personally, I think you\u2019d be a sucker not to enter a free-ticket sweepstakes for Blade.\n\u201cUh, Sam, would you please clean up your mess?\u201d\n\u201cShannon will eat it,\u201d Sam said.\n\u201cShannon hates chips,\u201d I reminded him.\nSam reached for a sponge. \u201cBossy, bossy, bossy.\u201d",

When a boy is forceful and responsible, people say he\u2019s \u201cstrong-willed\u201d or \u201ca born leader.\u201d But if you\u2019re a girl, you\u2019re \u201cbossy.\u201d\nFrankly, I take it as a compliment.\nI think of myself as the strong, silent type. Well, maybe not so silent. I tend to speak my mind. A lot.\nOkay, the strong, loud type.\nTrust me, when you have a family the size of mine, you have to be loud. How big is my family? Sixteen. Three grown-ups, seven kids, and six pets.\nIt\u2019s a good thing our house is so big. You might even say it\u2019s a mansion. My stepfather, Watson Brewer, is a millionaire. But don\u2019t picture a snobby guy with a year-round suntan and mirrored sunglasses. He\u2019s quiet and balding, and he likes to garden and cook.\nThe third grown-up in our house is my grandmother, Nannie. She moved in with us after Watson and Mom adopted my adorable two-and-a-half-year-old sister, Emily Michelle, who was born in Vietnam. Watson\u2019s two kids from a previous marriage live with us during alternate months. (Karen\u2019s seven and Andrew\u2019s four.) This month they were with their other parents, the Engles.\nAge-wise, I\u2019m somewhere in the middle. Which kind of makes me the hub of the family (ahem). I\u2019m thirteen, although if you saw me you might guess younger. I\u2019m just over five feet tall. My friend Stacey thinks I should wear shoes with heels or lifts. My friend Claudia thinks I should fluff up my hair to create an illusion of height. Fat chance. The Kristy Thomas motto: Comfort over fashion. I think jeans and t\u2011shirts look and feel great, and I like to wear my hair pulled back into a ponytail. Why change a perfect combination? End of argument.\nHere are some other things you need to know about me: I love sports, especially baseball. I\u2019m in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. I am the founder and president of the Baby\u2011sitters Club, or BSC, which I will tell you about later.\nIn case you\u2019re wondering \u2014 yes, I have a biological dad. Yes, he\u2019s alive. And no, I don\u2019t know exactly where he is. His name is Patrick and he abandoned our family soon after David Michael was born. Mom says that my dad \u201chad problems connecting.\u201d As far as I can figure out, that means two things: (1) He couldn\u2019t hold down a job, and (2) he couldn\u2019t stand the pressures of parenthood and marriage.\nNeedless to say, things were tough after he left. But good old Mom pulled through (with a lot of help from Charlie at first, and then Sam and me as we grew older).",

I knew my grades would be good. Well, actually, better than good. I don\u2019t want to brag or anything, but I\u2019m an excellent student.\n\nWho am I? Mallory Pike. Mal to my friends. I\u2019m eleven years old and live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. And I\u2019m a sixth\u2011grader at Stoneybrook Middle School.\n\n\"What\u2019s the good news?\" Rachel Robinson asked, from her desk in front of me.\n\n\"The good news is, this is only a progress report,\" Mrs. Frederickson said. \"It\u2019s not your final grade. You still have nearly a month to work hard and bring up your scores if you need to.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s the good news?\" Benny muttered.\n\nMrs. Frederickson ignored Benny\u2019s comment and began calling our names.\n\n\"Mallory Pike.\" Mrs. Frederickson waved my report in the air. I left my desk in the third row and walked to the front of the room.\n\nMrs. Frederickson smiled over the top of her glasses. \"Congratulations, Mallory. You should be very proud.\"\n\nI smiled back as I reached for my midterm report. The piece of paper slipped through my fingers and wafted to the floor between Randy Rademacher and Laura Nelson.\n\nRandy\u2019s eyes nearly bugged out of his head as he gasped, \"Straight A\u2019s? What a brainiac!\"\n\nThat wave thing happened again. Only this time everyone was staring at me and repeating, \"Straight A\u2019s!\"\n\n\"She thinks she\u2019s so smart,\" Janet O\u2019Neal whispered across the aisle behind me. \"Miss Know-it-all!\"\n\nThat did it. First the tips of my ears turned red. Then my cheeks. Then my freckles lit up. In an instant my whole face was glowing.\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut and made a secret wish for the floor to open up and swallow me. (It didn\u2019t.) I had to pick up my report and walk stiffly back to my desk.\n\nLuckily, my best friend, Jessica Ramsey, was there to support me. She patted me on the shoulder and whispered, \"All right, Mal!\"",

There are eight of us. Yes, eight!\n\nPeople call us stair\u2011step kids because we were born one right after the other. First there\u2019s me, then Byron, Adam, and Jordan, who are ten. They\u2019re identical triplets.\n\nThen comes Vanessa, who\u2019s nine. She\u2019s our dreamy poet, and she is the slowest person on the planet. Mom has to wake Vanessa twenty minutes before everyone else, because it takes her so long to get dressed.\n\nNicky, eight, is a ball of energy. He likes softball, hates girls, and is a champion hider.\n\nMargo is seven. She\u2019s the reason barf bags were invented. She gets carsick, airsick \u2014 Margo even throws up on merry\u2011rounds.\n\nAnd last but not least, there\u2019s Claire, who\u2019s five. She can be lovable and huggable one second, and the queen of temper tantrums the next.\n\nMom and Dad bring the Pike total to ten. Can you imagine what our family vacations are like? They\u2019re nuts. We have to take two cars.\n\nMost of us Pikes have blue eyes and chestnut\u2011colored hair. I\u2019m the only one whose hair is reddish and curly. I\u2019m also the only one with braces. (Lucky me.) I have pierced ears, because I finally convinced my parents to let me get them pierced. But I wear glasses, and I have to wait until I\u2019m fifteen to wear contacts.\n\nI\u2019m hardworking and very responsible. For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve helped Mom and Dad take care of my brothers and sisters. I started out as an unpaid mother\u2019s helper but soon advanced to paid baby\u2011sitter. I even became a member of the BSC (Baby\u2011sitters Club). But I\u2019ll tell you about that later.\n\nThe greatest moment in my life: winning the Young Author\u2019s Day Award for Best Overall Fiction at my school.\n\nThe worst moment: coming down with mononucleosis and having to quit the Baby\u2011sitters Club temporarily. (I\u2019m back in it now.)\n\nI like studying. And I like earning good grades. I just don\u2019t necessarily like the whole school to know about it. But, boy, does word travel fast.",

When she first moved to Stoneybrook, some people made fun of her just because she was the only black student in sixth grade. Isn\u2019t that stupid?\n\nLuckily, that\u2019s changed. Jessi and her family \u2014 her sister, Becca (short for Rebecca), and baby brother, Squirt (John Philip Ramsey, Jr.), her mom and dad, and her Aunt Cecelia \u2014 are very happy here now.\n\nJessi, who has gorgeous long legs and graceful arms, dreams of becoming a famous ballerina. And I\u2019m sure she will. She is a star student at her dancing school in Stamford and has already danced the lead in several productions, including the ballet Copp\u00e9lia.\n\nJessi and I have a lot in common. We absolutely love horse books, especially ones written by Marguerite Henry. We also love kids, and we\u2019re junior officers in the Baby\u2011sitters Club. We both think Benny Ott can be a major pain. Especially today.\n\n\u201cStraight A\u2019s, huh, Mallory?\u201d Benny said, shoving his face in between Jessi and me as we made our way down the hall. \u201cI could do that, if I cared.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, right, Benny,\u201d Jessi shot back.\n\nBenny crossed his eyes and made his standard goon face.\n\nI would have laughed, but too many people were teasing me about my grades.\n\nJessi and I had reached the door to Mr. Williams\u2019s class, when someone else grabbed my arm.",

          "text": "Forget about the clothes and the videos. Off we went.\n\nThank goodness. I was starving. All day long I\u2019d been so nervous I could barely eat.\n\nYou see, Dawn and Jeff Schafer happen to be my stepsiblings. She\u2019s thirteen, like me, and he\u2019s ten. Dawn is the only sister I have ever had, and I miss her sooo much. I count the days between her visits.\n\nDawn and Jeff live in Palo City, California, with their dad. I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut.\n\nWhy do two stepsisters live far apart? Well, it\u2019s a long story. A tale of two coasts.\n\nIt starts in Palo City, where Dawn was born and raised. When Sharon and Mr. Schafer divorced, Sharon decided to move back to her hometown, which happened to be Stoneybrook. Jeff couldn\u2019t make the adjustment. (Eventually he begged to move back with his dad, and Sharon let him.) Dawn liked Stoneybrook, though. She and I became friends, and we soon discovered an incredible Big Secret \u2014 my dad and her mom had been madly in love in high school. Well, we went right to work. We reintroduced them, wedding bells were soon chiming, and the rest is history.\n\nDad and I moved to Dawn\u2019s house, a two\u2011hundred\u2011year\u2011old farmhouse. Dawn and I grew as close as if we\u2019d known each other forever. Unfortunately, though, Dawn became homesick for California. Like Jeff, she felt she had to move back.\n\nWhich is why she\u2019s there and I\u2019m here.\n\nSigh.\n\nI, by the way, am Mary Anne Spier. My friends and I were waiting at the airport. Stoneybrook is a little more than an hour away, and I had managed to convince Sharon and my dad to take both cars to the airport, because the entire Baby\u2011sitters Club wanted to surprise Dawn. (The BSC is a group I belong to, and I\u2019ll tell you all about it later.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy to persuade my dad. He said that taking both cars was \u201coverkill\u201d and \u201ca waste of gas.\u201d\n\nHe is Mr. Practical.\n\nSharon\u2019s response? \u201cCome on, Richard, the more the merrier!\u201d\n\nThank goodness Sharon hasn\u2019t grown homesick for California. She\u2019s so much fun. In many ways she\u2019s the opposite of Dad \u2014 she\u2019s relaxed and absentminded, and he\u2019s conservative and super\u2011organized \u2014 but in a funny way they\u2019re a perfect match. Sharon has totally changed his life. Mine, too.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what it meant to have a mom until I was thirteen. My real mother died when I was a baby. Dad raised me by himself.\n\nI didn\u2019t mind being an only child. Dad took great care of me, even though he was strict. Kristy, my best friend, used to call him the King of Rules. It\u2019s kind of true. Until seventh grade I wasn\u2019t allowed to have my ears pierced. I had to keep my hair in pigtails and wear these long, little\u2011girlish skirts all the time. Kids teased me about it. It took Dad forever to accept that I was growing up. Fortunately, he\u2019s changed a lot. If you saw me now you\u2019d have no trouble believing I\u2019m a thirteen\u2011year\u2011old eighth\u2011grader. I have brown hair, which I wear short, and if you had to name my clothing style, you might call it preppy casual. And yes, I do have pierced ears.",

(I think Dad does, too, but he doesn\u2019t show it.)\n\nMy friends and I slapped trays onto the metal rack and pushed them along. The foods of choice seemed to be salad and chips, except for Claudia the Junk Food Maniac, who selected chocolate pudding, a brownie with a scoop of chocolate ice cream, and a Ring\u2011Ding.\n\nAs we took seats, Abby was cracking up at Claudia\u2019s tray. \"You sure you don\u2019t want some sprouts with that?\"\n\n\"For your information, chocolate is a high\u2011energy foodstuff,\" Claudia informed her.\n\n\"Foodstuff?\" Kristy murmured.\n\n\"Why do you need high energy to wait in an airport?\" Stacey asked.\n\n\"The anxiety,\" Claudia said, unwrapping her Ring\u2011Ding, \"is exhausting.\"\n\nWe all dug in, giggling and chatting. Around us, the cafeteria was beginning to fill up. I noticed a family of five \u2014 a dad and a mom with two young boys and a girl \u2014 sitting a few tables away from us.\n\nKristy had her eyes on them. She\u2019s the founder and president of the BSC, and whenever she sees a family like that, you can almost see a neon light blinking in her head: CLIENTS \u2026 CLIENTS \u2026 CLIENTS \u2026\n\n\"I wonder if they live in Stoneybrook,\" she said softly.\n\nStacey rolled her eyes. \"Kristy, puh\u2011leeze.\"\n\n\"Well, they could,\" Kristy insisted. \"Or they could know someone who does. The worst they could say is no.\"\n\nClaudia\u2019s jaw dropped. \"You\u2019re not actually thinking of asking them?\"\n\n\"Well \u2026\"\n\n\"You would embarrass your best friends in the middle of a huge international airport?\" Claudia barreled on. \"You would bother this innocent family while they\u2019re trying to enjoy a peaceful meal?\"\n\nI glanced at the innocent family.

We \u2014 my mother; my twin sister, Anna; and I \u2014 moved here recently from Long Island to a bigger house in a kid\u2011friendly neighborhood when my mother got a new publishing job in New York City. Life was supposed to get easier.\n\nEasier was not the word that came to mind when I contemplated moving from the house where we had lived for as long as I could remember. For one thing, I was the star forward, co\u2011captain, and leading scorer on my school\u2019s soccer team. I had friends. Some of our relatives lived nearby. And, well, the truth is that the worst part was leaving the house we\u2019d been living in when my dad was killed in an automobile accident four years ago. A truck crashed into my father\u2019s car. The driver of the truck was barely even hurt.\n\nSomehow, I thought leaving the house meant we were leaving the memory of my father behind.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t true. In fact, it turned out to be just the opposite, because during the move, Anna and I found a box of our father\u2019s things that our mother had packed away right after he died. We hardly ever talk about what happened, but when we showed Mom the box, well \u2014 we talked.\n\nAfter that, things between Mom and me and Anna were better.\n\nAnyway, now we live here and I\u2019ve made new friends, secured my rightful place on the soccer team, become the co\u2011coach of a kids' softball team, and become a successful businesswoman. That last part is where the BSC comes in.",

But more about that later.\n\nThe only thing you need to know about the BSC right now is that it meets Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at Claudia Kishi\u2019s (Claudia is the vice\u2011president) at five\u2011thirty P.M. sharp.\n\nWhich is a mild word for the look Madame President Kristy would give me if I were late.\n\nI flew past Claudia\u2019s sister, Janine, with a breathless \u201cHi \u2014 late\u201d when I entered the house. I took the stairs two at a time. I flung open the door of Claudia\u2019s room with such force it banged against the wall.\n\nKristy looked up from the director\u2019s chair she commandeers at every meeting. She raised the visor that is her BSC crown, glanced over at the clock as it changed to 5:30, and said, \u201cThis meeting of the BSC will come to order.\u201d\n\nYippee. I wasn\u2019t late.\n\nI slid down the side of Claudia\u2019s bed and gasped, \u201cWater. Give me water.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about orange juice mixed with seltzer?\u201d asked Stacey McGill, who is our treasurer. \u201cI have to mix them because the orange juice would be too much sugar for me otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d I said gratefully.\n\nAfter I had slaked my thirst and Kristy had fielded a couple of phone calls for baby\u2011sitting jobs, she looked at me and said, \u201cWell, Abby, we\u2019re glad you could make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe, too,\u201d I said. I meant it. I like the meetings. My closest friends in Stoneybrook are my fellow BSC members.\n\n\u201cHow did the training go?\u201d asked Mary Anne, looking up from the record book she keeps as secretary of the BSC. \u201cIs it really only for one day?\u201d\n\nI nodded and Mary Anne made a note in the book.\n\n\u201cAre you free to take on more baby\u2011sitting jobs, then? You know August is a busy month for us,\u201d she said. \u201cHow many days will practice and games take up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly, but of course I\u2019m free to take jobs. On a case\u2011by\u2011case basis,\u201d I said loftily.\n\nKristy snorted and Mary Anne looked at me quizzically. Mallory Pike said to Jessi Ramsey in a loud whisper that was meant to be heard, \u201cWow, Abby must be way important now to be so busy.\u201d\n\nI grinned. \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is the deal. Remember when my soccer coach recommended me for the Special Olympics Unified Team program after I said I wanted to get more soccer practice?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what the girl needs,\u201d said Claudia to no one in particular. \u201cMore soccer.\u201d\n\nI ignored her. \u201cWell",

          "text": "I stared into a pair of intense green eyes. They stared back at me, their gaze fixed and unwavering \u2014 kind of spooky. \u201cCool,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cDefinitely cool,\u201d agreed Barbara Hirsch, nodding thoughtfully. \u201cStacey, the eyes are awesome.\u201d\n\nWe were outside the back door of Stoneybrook Middle School (SMS), putting the finishing touches on a papier\u2011m\u00e2ch\u00e9 jaguar. We\u2019d received permission to work there during our study hall.\n\nThe September afternoon was a little chilly, as it often is here in Connecticut this time of year, but we didn\u2019t mind. We were hoping the gooey paper strips would dry faster in the light breeze.\n\nThe jaguar is our school mascot. Barbara and I are on the SMS Pep Squad, and we\u2019d built the jaguar in preparation for the school\u2019s first big football game of the season. The Pep Squad members would carry him onto the field during halftime.\n\nBarbara and I had been working on him every day after school, and he was finally done. Well, almost done. Barbara had just applied the last strip of papier\u2011m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Now he needed to dry, and then we could paint him. But painting would be the fun, easy part.\n\nThe hard part had been building the jaguar from pieces of balsa wood and then draping the goo\u2011soaked papier\u2011m\u00e2ch\u00e9 strips over him. He was big, about the size of a kid. If Claudia hadn\u2019t helped, I don\u2019t think we could have done it.\n\nClaudia Kishi is my best friend and a super\u2011talented artist. She isn\u2019t on the Pep Squad, but she can\u2019t resist an art project that cries out for her touch. She\u2019d helped us with the construction of the frame, and it had been her idea to stick large green marbles in the head for eyes.\n\nThat\u2019s what I had just finished doing. I\u2019d pushed the marbles into the jaguar\u2019s wet papier\u2011m\u00e2ch\u00e9 head. As the stuff hardened, it would hold the marbles in place. At least, I hoped it would.\n\nWe heard the last buzzer of the day. \u201cI can\u2019t stay much longer,\u201d I told Barbara. \u201cI have a BSC meeting today.\u201d BSC stands for Baby\u2011sitters Club. It\u2019s one of the most important things in my life, but I\u2019ll tell you more about it later.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Barbara replied as she smoothed a bump in the jaguar\u2019s long tail. \u201cLet\u2019s just let him dry a few more minutes, then we\u2019ll carry him back to the art room. We\u2019ll have to be careful, though. He\u2019s still so fragile. Maybe we could slide him onto a piece of cardboard. I\u2019ll go see if one of the custodians can help me find a big box.\u201d But Barbara didn\u2019t leave. She stood there admiring our marvelous creation.\n\nWe could hear lockers slamming inside. Buses were pulling into the parking lot. Kids began running out the back door.\n\nWorking with Barbara had been fun. It was the first time I\u2019d seen her show real enthusiasm about anything in awhile. Not long ago, Barbara\u2019s best friend, Amelia Freeman, was killed by a drunk driver. Barbara had been devastated. Lately, however, she seemed to be pulling out of her depression. She\u2019d thrown herself into this fall\u2019s Pep Squad activities, especially into making the jaguar.",

          "text": "I was smiling to myself, admiring the jaguar and thinking about the change in Barbara. I glanced up just in time to see a girl about to walk right into the jaguar.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I yelled.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d Barbara shouted.\n\nToo late. The girl\u2019s foot smashed into his mushy rib cage.\n\n\u201c Oh my gosh!\u201d she cried, startled. \u201cOh, no! Yuck!\u201d\n\nI cringed as her black boot shot through to the other side.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said as she hopped backward, the jaguar still stuck to her foot. She managed to push it off, but she lost her balance. Barbara grabbed her from behind, to keep her from falling backward. But that sent the girl toppling forward. Her hands shot out to protect herself as she fell \u2014 onto the jaguar. By the time she hit the ground, her hand was buried in the jaguar\u2019s back.\n\nPulling her hand out, she looked up at Barbara and me, red\u2011faced. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said in a small, embarrassed voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t see him.\u201d\n\nI wanted to cry. Our beautiful jaguar was ruined. It was hard to believe that something that had taken days to construct could be wrecked in mere seconds.\n\nBut after all, it had been an accident. I felt sorry for the girl. She obviously felt bad, and she looked funny too, sitting there covered in papier\u2011m\u00e2ch\u00e9 glop.\n\nI glanced at Barbara for her reaction. She simply looked stunned. Her jaw was open and her eyes were wide, as if she couldn\u2019t believe what had just happened. Then she pulled herself together and extended a hand to the girl to help her up. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cFine, if you don\u2019t count being so embarrassed and sorry I want to disappear off the planet,\u201d the girl replied glumly as she took Barbara\u2019s hand. She had a slightly odd way of speaking. It wasn\u2019t an accent exactly, but she stretched the words out in an unusual singsong.\n\nI knew she was new in school and new to Stoneybrook, but I didn\u2019t know her name or where she\u2019d come from.\n\nI plucked a pair of black\u2011rimmed glasses from the grass and handed them to her. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said, putting them on. \u201cI was cleaning these when I walked into your big cat here. I suppose that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nBarbara and I gazed down at our wrecked creation. I bent to scoop up the two green marbles, which had rolled to my feet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Tess Swinhart,\u201d she said. \u201cNot that it\u2019s a name you\u2019ll necessarily want to remember.\u201d\n\nThat last comment made me laugh a little and I felt my shock fade. Turning to the girl, I took a good look at her.\n\nShe was tall, I\u2019d guess at least five feet nine, and big boned, with broad shoulders. She wasn\u2019t fat, but she was a very large person. Her hair was light blonde. The thick black frames of her glasses might be the first thing \u2014 the only thing \u2014 you noticed about her face. I\u2019d seen her without them, though, so I had a different impression. She had light blue eyes, a slightly upturned nose, and a wide mouth. An unusual face, but not bad looking.\n\nShe wore a short, pale pink cardigan buttoned up to the top. She covered a white blouse with a lace\u2011trimmed Peter Pan collar, which peeked over the cardigan. He",

Then I picked up Emily and twirled her around. \u201cYou are an excellent dog trainer,\u201d I said, squeezing her tight. Emily squeezed me back. Shannon, eager to be part of the action, bumped up against my ankles and gave a couple of yelps.\n\nI lowered Emily to the ground and flopped down beside her. Shannon nuzzled my ear and licked my cheek. The warm afternoon sun lit up the golden yellow leaves of the big maple tree I lay beneath, and the sky was a brilliant blue. It was a perfect fall day, a Monday in early October, and I was perfectly happy. I could think of nowhere I\u2019d rather be, nothing I\u2019d rather be doing. The day was made for scuffling around in the leaves with my little sister and our puppy.\n\nI sighed with contentment. Emily and Shannon sighed too.",

What I do have is, well, age.\n\nYou see, I\u2019m thirteen, which is approximately a year older than everyone in my class. Yes, I\u2019m supposed to be in eighth grade. In fact, I was in eighth grade at the beginning of the year, but my teachers sent me back. Why? So they wouldn\u2019t have to give me a \u201cClueless\u201d on my report card.\n\nOkay, I\u2019m exaggerating. According to my guidance counselor, Mrs. Amer, I\u2019m \u201cright\u2011brain overdeveloped,\u201d which is a polite way of saying I\u2019m really good in art but I can\u2019t spell or do math.\n\nMy genius sister, Janine, just calls me \u201cbrain\u2011dead.\u201d She\u2019s in high school but she takes college courses in subjects I\u2019ve never heard of. My parents are smart too. Mom\u2019s a librarian and Dad\u2019s an investment banker. So what happened to me? Well, I have a theory. You see, my grandmother, Mimi, was sensitive and artistic. I think her genes skipped a generation and reached me. (Janine insists that can\u2019t happen, but obviously this is the one time in her life when she is wrong.) Mimi was very Old World. She was born and raised in Japan. You might not think she and I would have much in common, but we were soul mates. I felt so lost when she died.\n\nBoy \u2026\n\nBoy \u2026 did I want to cry on Mimi\u2019s shoulder when I was sent back to seventh grade. I thought I\u2019d ruined the Kishi name forever. I felt humiliated and stupid. And I was devastated about leaving my best friends.\n\nBut I\u2019ve changed. Now I\u2019m glad it happened. First of all, my left brain is doing just fine. My grades are good and I\u2019m understanding math for the first time in my life. (I really can\u2019t spell, though. Some things are just hopeless.) Second of all, I still spend time with my eighth\u2011grade friends, especially the ones who belong to the Baby\u2011sitters Club (more about that later). Third, I\u2019ve made some incredible new friends \u2014 Joanna Fried, Josh Rocker, Jeannie Kim, and Shira Epstein. And last but not least \u2026 ta\u2011da! I have a steady boyfriend.

His head was on his desk, and he was using his forearms as a pillow.\n\nMy first instinct was to nudge him awake. But I listened to my second instinct instead, which was to sit still. Ms. Pilley was approaching him with an icy stare, which meant he was dead meat no matter what I did.\n\n\u201cAHEM!\u201d she said.\n\nMark opened his eyes with a start. \u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may be the King of the Seventh Grade,\u201d said Ms. Pilley, \u201cbut in my classroom you are not entitled to a royal nap.\u201d\n\nThe class started tittering. Mark sat up obediently, a pencil at the ready. He looked very earnest and slightly ashamed. But I could tell by his expression that he was soaking up the attention.\n\nWhat a ham.\n\nA cute ham, though. Mark has the most gorgeous long, brown hair and about a hundred different smiles, each one devastating. Needless to say, he was elected King of the Seventh Grade by a landslide.\n\nThe Queen? Moi.\n\nHow did a seventh\u2011grade newcomer like me become so popular so quickly? With a lot of help from my friends, especially Josh. They all campaigned for me. I was kind of embarrassed by the sudden fame, but being Queen was a great way to meet people.\n\nIncluding a great boyfriend.\n\n\u201cNow, listen up,\u201d Ms. Pilley said. \u201cThe annual SMS Color War will begin Friday, a week from today, and it will last through the following Friday. Here are the results of last week\u2019s balloting \u2026\u201d\n\nThis I wanted to hear. I love the SMS Color War. It\u2019s a competition among the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades \u2014 sports contests, spelling bees, bake sales, weird games, anything goes. The winning class receives a check from the Stoneybrook Chamber of Commerce, to be donated to charity. Each class chooses two things: a color, which all members have to wear during the competitions, and a charity to donate the proceeds to.\n\nMs. Pilley listed the three chosen charities (ours was the Stoneybrook Adult Literacy Program), and then continued, \u201c \u2018The eighth grade chose the color blue; the sixth grade, white; and the seventh grade, orange.\u2019 \u201d\n\nClank went my jaw as it hit the desktop.\n\nOrange?\n\nThe entire class was going to have to wear orange?\n\nWho on earth looks good in orange?\n\nMaybe a circus clown.\n\n\u201cYou must be joking,\u201d I murmured.\n\nMs. Pilley looked up. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I lied.\n\nRRRRRRIIING! went the homeroom bell.\n\n\u201c \u2018Volunteers are still needed for all positions, including events coordinators for each grade\u2019!\u201d Ms. Pilley shouted frantically as we sprang up from our seats.\n\nI g",

          "text": "Click. As I placed Dad\u2019s credit card on the counter at the BookCenter in the Washington Mall, the plastic made the softest sound. It\u2019s amazing how a little thing like the click of a credit card can send thrills through you.\n\nGlancing at my friend Kristy Thomas, I grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d I whispered with a shiver of excitement.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Kristy raised an eyebrow. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not to her. Her stepdad, Watson Brewer, is a millionaire, after all. But my father had never before allowed me to use his credit card. It made me feel so incredibly grown\u2011up, so sophisticated, to be doing my Christmas shopping with plastic this year.\n\nClick, again \u2014 the sound of the saleswoman picking up the card. She read it and then turned to me. \u201cDo you have any identification?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d I fished through my wallet for my Stoneybrook Middle School student identification card and handed it to her. The woman studied it intently. Maybe it was my imagination, but she seemed unsure that the picture on the card was of me.\n\n\u201cI had long hair when that picture was taken,\u201d I explained. \u201cBut I had it cut shorter. You can tell it\u2019s me, though. Mary Anne Spier. See? The same name as on the credit card. Well, not the exact same name. My dad is Richard Spier, of course, but the last name matches.\u201d\n\nThe woman looked up and smiled as she handed the I.D. card back to me. \u201cYes, it\u2019s you, all right. Sorry, but I have to check.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d I assured her. \u201cI guess you can\u2019t be too careful, especially now, around the holidays.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded as she processed my sale. I\u2019d bought my stepmom, Sharon, a thick book called Veggies Rule. She\u2019s a vegetarian and eats only healthy foods. The book wasn\u2019t only a cookbook; it also had great art and amusing stories about vegetables. \u201cShe\u2019ll like this, don\u2019t you think?\u201d I asked Kristy.\n\n\u201cWhen you put it together with the automatic bread maker you bought her, it makes an awesome gift,\u201d Kristy replied. \u201cIt might be a little too awesome.\u201d\n\nThe woman returned Dad\u2019s card and handed me the book in a bag. I thanked her and turned to Kristy. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne or the other would have been enough, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, but Sharon\u2019s so great and she\u2019s had such a hard year with Dawn moving away and all,\u201d I said, defending my spending. Dawn Schafer, my stepsister, is Sharon\u2019s daughter. This year she decided to move back to California to live with her father, brother, and her father\u2019s new wife.\n\nDawn\u2019s decision to move took us all by surprise. She had seemed happy living with Dad, Sharon, and me. For a while, I was so upset that I didn\u2019t notice how sad it was making Sharon.\n\nNo matter how much Dawn tried to explain that she wasn\u2019t moving because of us \u2014 she simply missed the West Coast \u2014 it hurt. We all miss her.\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re softhearted and generous,\u201d Kristy told me. \u201cI admire that. But didn\u2019t your father give you a limit on what you could spend?\u201d\n\n\u201cSort of.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Kristy is a get\u2011to\u2011the\u2011point person and has no patience for vague answers. But sometimes the truth isn\u2019t so clear\u2011cut.\n\n\u201cHe said not to spend more than I could afford to pay back,\u201d I explained.\n\n\u201cWell? How much is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt depends.\u201d\n\nKristy blew out a puff of air and her brown bangs flew up. She didn\u2019t have to say anything. I knew she was thinking, Can\u2019t you be more specific than that? Kristy and I have been close friends since we were little.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be exactly sure!\u201d I cried, throwing my arms out. (Which caused all the shopping bags I had slung on my arms to slide back and hit me on the sides.) \u201cI don\u2019t know the number of baby\u2011sitting jobs I\u2019m going to be able to take between now and Christmas. I can\u2019t tell how many will come in or who else will want them. It\u2019s been so busy, though. I think we\u2019ll all do well.\u201d\n\nI was talking about the Baby\u2011Sitters Club, otherwise known as the BSC. It\u2019s a club Kristy founded. Clients call one number and reach several qualified baby\u2011sitters at once. (I\u2019ll tell you more details later.) Ever since Thanksgiving, business had been outrageously busy. We could hardly handle the number of clients who called. So, even though I couldn\u2019t predict exactly the amount of money I\u2019d earn, I was sure it would be plenty.",

We headed toward Stuff \u2019N Nonsense, a funky store with lots of trendy jewelry. I\u2019d shopped for my friends yesterday, so today I only had family left to shop for, and then I\u2019d be done.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe how crowded the mall was. People knocked into us and didn\u2019t even realize it.\n\nWe passed through the center court on the first floor. The fountain that usually spurts pink water had been turned off and a huge Christmas tree stood in front of it. Beside it, some mall workers were busily hammering a platform into place. Soon a Santa would sit on the platform, taking gift orders from the excited kids who would line up to meet him. (Other years, Lear\u2019s department store had run a North Pole Village featuring Santa.

It read: HOLIDAY HELP WANTED. APPLY AT SPECIAL EVENTS OFFICE. \u201cOnly two weeks until Christmas, and they\u2019re still hiring extra help?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cHanukkah comes after Christmas this year, and so does Kwanzaa,\u201d I pointed out, \u201cso there\u2019s really more than two weeks until gift\u2011buying ends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Kristy replied. \u201cDo people exchange Kwanzaa gifts?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the actual tradition of Kwanzaa, but sometimes people do give gifts anyway,\u201d I said, trying to remember what I\u2019d learned in school, and from my friend Jessi Ramsey. \u201cAnd even if they\u2019re not buying gifts, they still buy new tablecloths and candles and baskets \u2014 things like that.\u201d\n\nFor a moment we stood and watched the work",

Which made sense, considering how many people had shown up to audition. Hundreds.\n\nSeeing that letter brought it all back. The noisy, jammed theater. The long wait. The feeling that I didn't belong there.\n\nI felt so inferior to some of those dancers. I'm eleven, which meant I had to audition in the eleven-to-thirteen-year-old category. I am advanced for my age, but still. The older kids have much cleaner lines and more solid technique. Totally unfair, if you ask me.\n\nThe night of the audition I cried myself to sleep. Daddy and Mama both had to comfort me. They both told me not to give up hope.\n\nAs you can see, I take dance very seriously. I practice tour jet\u00e9s on the way to school. I pli\u00e9 in the cafeteria line. I do stretching exercises whenever I'm standing still. I take ballet lessons in Stamford, Connecticut. (That's the city closest to the town where I live, Stoneybrook.) But I've been a dance fanatic since before birth. Mama felt me high-kicking when she was pregnant. As a baby I would do arabesques in my playpen.\n\n(Time-out. For you nondancers, those French words are not names of pastries. They describe ballet movements. Basically, an arabesque is a forward bend with one leg extended backward. A tour jet\u00e9 is a series of leaps, and a pli\u00e9 is a knee bend.)\n\nI still shiver when I think about the time I saw a Dance New York performance. It was in New York City several months ago. My parents took me to see it. The founder and main choreographer, David Brailsford, is a genius. A legend. His dances combine jazz, African rhythms, and classical ballet.\n\nReally, I should have been happy just for the opportunity to audition for Dance New York.\n\nAt least that was what I had told myself.",

Abigail Stevenson, formerly of Long Island, now of Stoneybrook, Connecticut. My mother, my twin sister, Anna, and I moved here recently when Mom got a big promotion and wanted to make a new start in a safe neighborhood after the death of my father. He died four years ago in a car wreck. I didn\u2019t want to move. I felt as if we were leaving my father forever, somehow. But moving brought us closer together as a family and encouraged us to talk a little about what losing Dad meant. So the change of locale turned out to be okay. Here, as on Long Island, I\u2019m a soccer star, in pursuit of the Athlete of the Year title. I\u2019m okay in school, have major allergies (cat litter, milk, shellfish \u2014 you name it), and have asthma. I\u2019m hoping to outgrow both when I get older (it does happen), but meanwhile I have to be careful about what I eat, watch the pollen count in the spring, and carry a prescription inhaler (a sort of tube of asthma medicine from which you inhale) at all times. My eight\u2011minutes\u2011older twin, Anna, is not athletic, asthmatic, or allergic (although she does have scoliosis). She plays the violin in the school orchestra and practices her music a couple of hours each day before dinner. In fact, music is one of the reasons Anna declined to join the Baby\u2011sitters Club (or BSC) when membership was offered to both of us. However, she and Shannon, another BSC member, have become good friends. Anna and I look alike, but we have different styles. We both have pointed faces, deep brown eyes, and dark curly hair. Also, we both wear contact lenses or glasses. But Anna\u2019s hair is shorter than mine (which is shoulder length) and she has bangs, while I don\u2019t. Kristy is my neighbor, schoolmate, and fellow Baby\u2011sitters Club member. Actually, she\u2019s the president of the BSC (more about that later) and one of the most outspoken, forceful people on the planet. She is also as stubborn as a rock. These are all qualities I usually admire, especially since I have them myself.",

Although she shares many of my best qualities, my keen sense of humor is not one of them. She doesn\u2019t always laugh at my jokes. \u201cThey\u2019re leaving,\u201d Kristy said. \u201cWho? The sexists? The racists? The politicians?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe Addisons!\u201d she exclaimed, giving me a Look. \u201cThe Addisons?\u201d I repeated stupidly. \u201cSean and Corrie,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd their parents too, of course.\u201d \u201cWhoa. Why?\u201d \u201cMrs. Addison got a major job offer in Seattle.\u201d Kristy paused and added, \u201cWashington.\u201d \u201cI know where Seattle is,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the way across the country. Wow, this is going to make baby\u2011sitting for them extremely time\u2011consuming. I mean, think about the commute.\u201d Kristy gave me another Look and I decided to lay off the jokes. I just said, \u201cI\u2019ll miss them.\u201d This was no joke. Sean Addison is ten and Corrie is nine, and two siblings couldn\u2019t be more different. Corrie is friendly and outgoing and artistically talented. She is an easy baby\u2011sitting charge and a naturally cool kid. Sean is musically talented. (At least I think he is. I couldn\u2019t carry a tune in a bucket, so I don\u2019t know for sure.) He plays the tuba. He is also moody and intense and takes things very personally. His over\u2011the\u2011top reactions have gotten him into trouble in the past and haven\u2019t made him easy to take care of, especially since he is not particularly fond of baby\u2011sitters. \u201cI\u2019ll miss them too,\u201d Kristy agreed. \u201cFor a while there, I thought Sean was going to be in contention for the title of Worst Kid Ever, but he looks like he\u2019s starting to deal with his problems.\u201d (Do you know what I think? I think Kristy has a soft spot for \u201cbad\u201d kids. She even grew to like Lou McNally, a previous recipient of the Worst Kid Ever title.) \u201cCorrie\u2019s nice too,\u201d Kristy added, and I hid a grin. \u201cCorrie\u2019s always been a nice kid,\u201d I agreed. \u201cI bet Sean grows up to be a pretty nice person.\u201d But we both knew that we probably wouldn\u2019t get to see what kind of person Sean grew up to be. Would he be wild and crazy? A mad scientist? A tuba wonder? A horror novelist? We sighed.",

          "text": "\"Aah! Alone at last.\" We gazed deeply into each other\u2019s eyes and smiled happily. Then the object of my affections began to drool.\n\nWas I grossed out? No way. I just wiped off the drool with the cuff of my shirt and went on gazing and smiling.\n\nNow, if I were talking about a guy \u2014 say, my boyfriend, Josh \u2014 things might be different. I'd be pretty freaked if he started to drool in front of me. But a little drool is nothing between me and my beloved cousin, Lynn. She can do no wrong, as far as I'm concerned. And since she's only six months old and teething, her lack of saliva control is no big surprise.\n\n\"I can't believe you're mine, all mine, for a whole week,\" I told Lynn. She gurgled happily. She may not be able to talk yet, but I can translate her little noises. She was letting me know she was as excited as I was about our time together.\n\nFive minutes earlier, Lynn's parents had finally left. My uncle Russ practically had to shove my aunt Peaches out the door. \"What if she starts running a fever?\" Peaches asked, clutching Lynn as if she couldn't bear to turn her over to me. \"What if she falls out of her crib?\"\n\n\"Claudia knows what to do,\" said my mother soothingly, putting an arm around Peaches. (They're sisters.) \"She can handle any situation that comes up. Remember, she's a professional baby-sitter.\"\n\nI nodded. \"That's right,\" I said. \"Lynn will be in the care of a full-fledged founding member of the BSC.\" I grinned proudly. I didn't have to explain to Peaches and Russ about the BSC. They know those initials stand for Baby-sitters Club, and they know what the club is about. You can't find better, more experienced sitters anywhere.\n\n\"Not to mention the BSC member's sibling and parents,\" added my older sister, Janine. \"We'll be here too.\"\n\n\"And you two deserve some time off,\" put in my dad. \"After all, you haven't had a vacation since Lynn was born.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear,\" said Russ. \"Now, let's say good-bye and be on our way. There's a golf ball with my name on it, and a nice hot sauna waiting for you.\" They'd booked a week at a classy resort about an hour and a half away. Russ pretended to swing a golf club. It was the first day of March, so he wouldn't be doing a lot of outdoor golfing. But the place had an indoor driving range, and Russ couldn't wait to check it out.\n\nReluctantly, Peaches handed Lynn over to me. \"Don't forget to warm her formula,\" she said. \"But don't make it too hot. She might \u2014\"\n\n\" \u2014 burn her mouth,\" I said, nodding as I hugged Lynn to my chest. \"I know.\" Peaches had given us a five-page memo detailing Lynn's routines. Not that I needed it. I've taken care of Lynn plenty of times \u2014 she's practically spent as much time at my house as she has at her parents'! But just to make Peaches feel comfortable, I recited her directions from page three, paragraph seven: \"Warm the formula until a few drops shaken on the inside of your wrist feel neither hot nor cold. Hold Lynn in a near-upright position for feeding. Make sure to burp her afterward.\" I could have continued, with the three paragraphs specifying exactly how to burp her, but it didn't seem necessary. Peaches was nodding.\n\n\"I guess she'll be okay,\" she said. \"After all, this is like her second home.\" She gave Lynn one last kiss, turned to join Russ, and, without looking back, managed to walk out the door. I knew that had required a humongous effort on her part, so I took pity on her. I followed them to the door and said in a squeaky voice, \"Bye-bye, Mama, bye-bye, Dada! Have a good time!\" I lifted Lynn's arm and made her wave to them. Russ cracked up, and even Peaches managed a shaky smile. I knew they'd have a terrific time once the trauma of leaving Lynn was over. I stood in the doorway, waving to them until their car was out of sight.",

          "text": "Speaking of \"myself,\" I guess I should tell you who I am. My name's Claudia, as you have already guessed. Claudia Lynn (yes, that's where the baby's name came from) Kishi. I'm thirteen years old and I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, with my mom, my dad, and Janine, who's sixteen. All of us are Japanese-American. Janine is a genius. My mom's a librarian (she'd left her job early that day in order to be home when Lynn arrived), and my dad does something I'll never understand with stocks and bonds. My mother's mother, Mimi, lived with us until she died not long ago. I was closer to Mimi than to anyone else in my family, and I miss her every single day. I wish she'd lived long enough to meet Lynn.\n\nEven though Lynn is only half Asian (Uncle Russ is Irish, with red hair and freckles), I think she'll grow up to look like her mom. She already has dark hair and dark, almond-shaped eyes. Maybe a freckle or two will pop out one day, just to make Russ feel better.\n\nAnd if I have anything to say about it, she'll be the most creatively dressed kid in Stoneybrook, thanks to her cousin Claud. I may not be a genius like Janine (I'm not even close, since she's taking college courses while she's in high school and I just spent some time repeating seventh grade), but if there's one thing I am good at, it's dressing with style and flair. Actually, I don't mean to sound egotistical, but I guess I'm pretty creative overall. I love to paint and draw and sculpt. In fact, I look at life in artistic terms. My room is full of projects in every stage, from just started to finished-but-could-still-be-improved-upon. And my outfits are one-of-a-kind creations, featuring my own embroidery, tie-dyeing, jewelry making, etc. I try to fix my hair a different way every day. I even find creative ways to make chores like table setting and salad making fun.\n\nHowever, I'm not so great at salad eating. I'd rather eat a Twinkie. I love junk food. It's sort of an obsession of mine. I keep an eye out for new products.",

I'd gotten up early to find Watson, my stepfather, sitting at the kitchen table, a coffee mug in one hand and what I thought were gardening catalogs spread out on the table around him.\n\nWatson and my grandmother, Nannie, who also lives with us, are the gardening gurus of Stoneybrook. They'd been poring over gardening books and catalogs all winter \u2014 making lists, drawing up diagrams, and throwing around phrases like \"soil acidity\" and \"companion planting.\"\n\nDon't ask me what any of this stuff means. I don't know. But it made sense that on a perfect April morning, Watson would wake up super-early to put in some extra gardening time.\n\n\"More coffee would be nice,\" he told me. \"And yes, it's decaffeinated. I am following doctor's orders, Kristy, don't worry.\" The corners of his eyes crinkled in a smile.\n\nI smiled back as I poured the coffee. Watson had a mild heart attack a little while ago, so he has to watch what he eats and does. I made myself some cereal with bananas and honey, fixed a couple of pieces of toast, and sat down at the table.\n\n\"Big gardening plans?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Yes. Nannie and I have been talking about the possibility of a water garden,\" Watson answered.\n\n\"You mean, like a pond?\"\n\n\"More like a small pool.\"\n\nI gestured at the brochures without really looking at them. \"Water gardens made easy, right?\" I guessed. \"Will the pool include ducks?\"\n\n\"No ducks. The pool will be too small for that. Maybe a few fish.\" Watson took a sip of coffee, watching me over the rim of his cup. Then he added, \"But these aren't gardening magazines. As a matter of fact, they're from the Guide Dog Foundation. Your mother and I are thinking of getting a dog from them.\"",

I'm thirteen years old and I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where I go to Stoneybrook Middle School (SMS), coach a little kids' softball team called Kristy's Krushers, and am president of the Baby\u2011sitters Club (more about that later).\n\nI'm also a member of a very large blended family. Watson is Watson Brewer. He is, as you know, my stepfather. He's also the CEO of Unity Insurance. When he had his heart attack, it made me realize just how important he is to me, which is why I'm a little, well, bossy about his sticking to what the doctor tells him.\n\nBut then, bossy comes naturally to me. I have two older brothers, Charlie (age seventeen) and Sam (fifteen); a younger brother, David Michael (who is seven); two younger stepsiblings who live with us part\u2011time, Andrew (four) and Karen (seven); and a Vietnamese baby sister, Emily Michelle (age two and a half). Out of all these people, I think it's safe to say that I'm seen as the bossiest.\n\nI don't think of it as being bossy, though. I call it being organized and getting results. When I take charge, I know things are going to get done, and that they're going to get done the right way.\n\nMy mother is even more organized than I am, which is one of the reasons she managed to keep our family together in the tough years after my father left us, back when David Michael was just a baby. Nannie is also strong\u2011willed \u2014 when Emily Michelle was adopted, Nannie insisted on moving in with us to help out. Also living with us are: Boo\u2011Boo, the cranky cat; a Bernese mountain dog puppy named Shannon; assorted goldfish, and a part\u2011time hermit crab and rat. We also have a resident ghost (or so says my very imaginative stepsister, Karen).\n\nWith all these people and animals in the family, I couldn't see why we would get another dog \u2014 unless it was for some very good reason.",

She's in our public relations department. Her daughter, Deb, is twelve. She's in the seventh grade at Stoneybrook Day School. Or will be, when she gets back to school.\"\n\nI knew who Deb Cooper was. My friend Shannon Kilbourne, who also goes to SDS, had told me what had happened to her. A few months ago, Deb had gotten very sick and had lost her eyesight.

She also refused to allow any of her old friends to visit.\n\nI looked again at the brochures on the table. \"You're getting a guide dog for Deb?\" I asked.\n\nOnce again, Watson had to slow me down. \"Not at all. Deb isn't old enough to have a guide dog, even if she were ready for one. And I don't think she is yet. Because of what happened to Deb, Mrs. Cooper had the idea that our company should sponsor a guide dog through the foundation. The more I heard about it, the more I wanted to get personally involved. So I've been talking to the foundation about becoming a puppy walker.\"\n\nThis time, I didn't jump to conclusions. I finished my cereal and nodded. \"A puppy walker?\"\n\n\"A puppy walker family takes a guide dog puppy and raises it from the time it is eight weeks old until it is fourteen months old. Then it goes back to the foundation for training to become a guide dog,\" Watson explained.\n\n\"Sort of like being foster parents,\" I said.\n\n\"Something like that.\"\n\n\"Cool. When do we start? What kind of puppy will we get? Do we get to choose? Do we \u2014\"\n\nWatson laughed out loud. \"We have to be interviewed first. Someone from the foundation will be here next Wednesday, assuming that everyone in the family agrees it's a good idea. If the foundation decides we'll make a suitable family, we'll go from there.\"\n\n\"I vote yes,\" I offered enthusiastically. \"I think it's a great idea.\"\n\nJust then, Nannie came into the room.",

          "text": "How should you feel about an ex-boyfriend? That's the question I asked myself as I sat in math class, staring at the back of Robert's head.\n\nRobert Brewster is my ex-boyfriend. Which, of course, means that you could call me, Stacey McGill, Robert's ex-girlfriend.\n\nNot that being his ex is how I define myself. I'm much more than that.\n\nFor starters, I'm my parents' daughter. Even though they're divorced, I'll never stop being their number-one kid.\n\nI'm also a New Yorker, born and raised (at least at first) in New York City. Now I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, with Mom. But I spend plenty of city weekends with Dad, who still lives in New York.\n\nI'm a friend. Claudia Kishi is my closest friend. And I'm part of a great group of friends who all belong to the Baby-sitters Club (also known as the BSC). I'll tell you more about them later, since they're a huge part of my life.\n\nI could add I'm a diabetic, although I don't usually think of myself that way. I'm simply a person who has this crummy illness called diabetes to deal with. Being diabetic means my body can't regulate the amount of sugar in my blood. In order to stay healthy, I have to eat properly, never let myself get too hungry, avoid sweets, and give myself insulin injections every day. It's a pain, but it's not the end of the world. It's just one part of my life. I do what I have to do and get on with the other parts.\n\nWho else am I? I'm a student \u2014 an eighth-grader at Stoneybrook Middle School (SMS), to be exact. My favorite and best subject is math, but I do pretty well in my other classes too.\n\nI suppose I should mention that I'm a girlfriend. I've been dating this great guy in New York City, named Ethan. He's an art student and totally cool. I met him around the time Robert and I broke up. To be completely honest, that was around the time Robert dumped me. No one likes to think of herself as someone who was dumped. But that's what happened. He did it in a really awful way too. He started seeing another girl, Andi Gentile, before he broke up with me. He didn't even have the nerve to tell me. I had to find out about it from other people. It was a pretty awful time for me. Even now, I don't like to remember it. Meeting Ethan then helped a lot, though. A whole lot.\n\nAs it turned out, it wasn't long before I was feeling totally great. Robert, on the other hand, was down in the dumps, because soon Andi broke up with him. So, here I had this interesting, sensitive, fun (not to mention awesomely handsome) new boyfriend. And Robert had nobody.\n\nNaturally, I felt the urge to say, \"Ha-ha, serves you right.\" But somehow I couldn't say it. I couldn't even think it for long. Robert seemed so upset that I felt sorry for him. He had been through two breakups in a short time. It made sense that he'd feel down. The problem was that Robert stayed down. After awhile, most people pull themselves together. They cheer up, move on. They become involved with someone new, or just date different people for a while. Robert hadn't even tried to date anyone since Andi broke up with him. And a lot of girls would love to go out with him.\n\nRobert's cute, with wavy hair, great dimples, and a knockout smile. His broad shoulders and dark eyes first attracted me to him, but later I fell for all of him. He's nice, and smart too. And he used to be a lot of fun. But after Andi broke up with him, Robert stayed bummed. He didn't give any other girls a chance to get close to him. He wasn't dating. And he was cutting his guy friends out of his life. Even his friend Alex. They used to be very close.\n\nI can understand why Robert might want some distance between himself and his old friends. They weren't exactly my favorite people. I thought they were cool when I first met them. I soon learned, though, that drinking, smoking, shoplifting, and thinking everything is dumb don't make you cool. When I remember that I blew off my true, loyal, BSC friends for those idiots, I feel so embarrassed. I did, though. I quit the club and everything. Luckily for me, I quickly saw my new \"friends\" for what they really are. And, luckier still, my true friends forgave me and let me rejoin the BSC.\n\nI was staring at Robert's head and thinking about these things when our teacher, Mr. Zizmore, called on Robert. \"If y equals a thousand, then what is the value of x? Mr. Brewster?\"\n\nRobert looked up, dazed, as if Mr. Zizmore's voice had called him back from somewhere very far away. \"Uh ... sorry ... I ... could you repeat the question, please?\"\n\nMr. Z. sighed, very annoyed, and repeated it.\n\nRobert gaped at him. \"I guess ... I ... um,\" he mumbled. He let his breath out in a whoosh of defeat. \"I ... I have no clue.\"\n\nA girl across the room giggled at that, probably just because she felt uncomfortable. I felt uncomfortable too. Embarrassed for Robert. He isn't bad at math. He should have known that answer. It was as if he just couldn't make his brain think about it.\n\nMr. Zizmore turned his gaze on me. \"What's the answer, Stacey?\"\n\nDespite thinking about Robert, I'd been half listening. I knew the answer. But I was torn. I wanted to say I didn't know, so Robert wouldn't look quite so bad. I couldn't, though. Acting dumb isn't my style. \"Two thousand,\" I replied, sure I was correct.\n\nMr. Z. turned and wrote two thousand on the board.\n\nRobert swiveled in his seat and looked at me. He rolled his eyes and forced a smile. I rolled my eyes and shrugged in reply. That body-language conversation meant the following: Robert: Wow, that was dumb of me. Me: Oh, well. That's life.\n\nFor that moment, I felt as if nothing bad had ever happened between me and Robert. This was almost the way things used to be, natural and easy. As if we'd never broken up.\n\nIt wasn't the same, though. Not exactly. For one thing, I wasn't in love with him anymore. And, for another, Robert never used to be in such a fog.\n\nWhat was going on with him?\n\nIt was Andi \u2014 of all people \u2014 who had first mentioned to me that something was wrong wi",

          "text": "I could not wait for summer. I usually love English, and reading and writing, and anything to do with books. But today I was having trouble concentrating.\n\nOutside a robin perched on the windowsill. Oak trees rustled in the breeze and puffy white clouds floated across the sky. The grass looked lush and green and welcoming. What was I doing inside? All I wanted to do was sit on that grass and talk to my friends about what we were going to do this summer.\n\nI always look forward to summer because that's when Dawn Schafer, my stepsister, comes back to Stoneybrook to visit. Dawn is one of my two best friends, and I miss her more than I can say. I cried my eyes out when she decided to move back to California. But I'm getting ahead of my story. I'll tell you more about my family later. First let me introduce myself.\n\nI'm Mary Anne Spier. I'm thirteen years old. I'm pretty short, and I have brown hair and brown eyes. People say I'm very sensitive, which is true. It doesn't take much for me to start crying. When my boyfriend, Logan, and I go to the movies, Logan often brings a box of tissues because I cry so much. (Is that embarrassing or what?) I'm shy too, but sometimes I think that being sensitive and shy helps me listen to people.\n\nI live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where I'm in the eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. My other best friend, Kristy Thomas, is in the eighth grade too. Kristy is as outgoing and assertive as I am shy. I guess opposites attract because we've been best friends for as long as I can remember.\n\nI've lived in Stoneybrook my whole life. I'm an only child, and my mother died when I was a baby. I don't remember her at all, but people who knew her are always telling me I look and act like her. For example, like me, my mother liked to sew and hated to cook.\n\nWhen my mother died, my dad was devastated, as you can imagine. He even sent me to live with my grandparents in Nebraska until he could cope a little better. I was too little to remember Nebraska now, but I do know that for most of my life my dad was rather strict with me. Kristy used to call him the King of Rules. Until eighth grade, I had to go to bed earlier than all my friends. And Dad used to pick out my clothes, which meant I wore babyish frilly blouses and long little-girlish skirts. I was not allowed to have my ears pierced, and I had to wear my hair in braids or pigtails. (Ugh.)\n\nIt took Dad forever to accept that I was growing up. Fortunately, with the help of my friends, I was able to encourage him to relax a little. Now I can pick out my own clothes, within reason. I like simple, conservative things \u2014 no frills or lace ever again (except maybe when I get married). I also have pierced ears and a haircut I like. I even have a reasonable curfew. So you see, things have changed for the better since I've been in eighth grade.\n\nDad is a lot happier too. Lately there's been a big change in our life \u2014 Sharon. Sharon happens to be Dawn's mom ... and my dad's new wife.\n\nDad and Sharon were high school sweethearts, right here in Stoneybrook. They broke up, though, because Sharon's parents did not approve of my dad. (Hmmph.) Sharon moved to California and lost touch with my father. Many years later, when I was in seventh grade, I became good friends with a girl named Dawn Schafer, who had just moved to Stoneybrook from California with her divorced mother and younger brother, Jeff. (Do you see a family picture emerging?)\n\nIt took Dawn and me awhile to realize that Dawn's mom was the Sharon in Dad's past, but when we made that connection, nothing could stop us. We reintroduced them, and Dad and Sharon fell in love all over again.\n\nThis is further proof that opposites attract, as I said before. Dad and Sharon could not be more different. My dad, Mr. Neat and Organized, is a lawyer. He alphabetizes the spices in our kitchen cabinet. He arranges his socks by color. And he always reads the newspaper in the same order \u2014 the business section first, then international news, national news, and (finally) local news.\n\nSharon, on the other hand, never puts anything in its place. I often find her sunglasses in the refrigerator and her mail in the bathroom. Plus, Sharon, like Dawn and Jeff, likes to eat healthy foods. And no red meat.\n\nBut all this does not really matter because Dad and Sharon love each other and are very happy. And so am I, because now I have a great stepsister and stepbrother, a great stepmom, and a great place to live. Dad and I moved into Sharon's cool farmhouse on Burnt Hill Road. It was built in the 1700s, and it has low ceilings, narrow hallways, a brick fireplace, a barn in the back, and best of all, a secret passageway that may be haunted.\n\nUnfortunately, Dawn does not live in our farmhouse anymore, at least not full-time. As I mentioned, she moved back to California to live with her dad (Jeff had done the same thing earlier). It wasn't that they didn't get along with my dad and me, or that they hated Stoneybrook. They were just terribly homesick.\n\nAnd soon Dawn was going to be back in Stoneybrook for the first time since Christmas. Usually she visits more often, but she's ...",

She gazed down at my open suitcase. \"What happened to it?\" she asked. Behind her glasses her brown eyes widened in alarm.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked as I snatched two racing\u2011style bathing suits from the hooks on the back of my door.\n\n\"Your suitcase is a mess!\" she cried.\n\n\"Who cares?\"\n\n\"Your clothes are going to get unbelievably wrinkled,\" she pointed out. \"You'll have to iron everything.\"\n\n\"Yeah, right!\" I couldn't picture myself ironing anything \u2014 especially on vacation. \"We're going to the beach. It's all right to be a little wrinkled.\"\n\nAnna stooped to the suitcase and started folding my shirts. \"You won't be a little wrinkled,\" she commented. \"You'll look like one big wrinkle.\"\n\nI rummaged in the bottom of my closet for my neon green flip\u2011flops. \"I like wrinkles,\" I insisted as I found one of them (but not the other).",

Someone once described me as spontaneous.\n\nI like to go, go, go. I love sports and I keep moving. Anna, on the other hand, can sit for hours practicing her violin. I admire her concentration and calm, but sitting still that long would drive me crazy.\n\nAt first glance, we don't even look that much alike anymore. As we've grown older, our individual styles have led to differences in our appearance. We both have curly brown hair, but I wear mine long, while Anna keeps hers short. Both of us have poor eyesight. Our glasses have different frames, though. Or, on a particular day I might wear my contact lenses, while Anna wears glasses. I'm slightly taller than Anna. Lately, though, she's been standing straighter than before because of her brace. (Anna has to wear a brace to help correct her scoliosis, which is a curvature of the spine. She wears it under her clothes and it's hardly noticeable. The doctor says she can do without it in a few years.) With Anna now standing straighter, the difference in our heights is minuscule.",

          "text": "I sat forward at my desk and gave Ms. Garcia my complete attention. She's my homeroom teacher, and what she was telling our class this morning was extremely interesting to me.\n\n\"This year the Stoneybrook Board of Education has worked with other schools in southern Connecticut and has come up with a new program called TOT \u2014 Teachers of Tomorrow. For three days student volunteers will be teaching some classes in place of the teachers,\" she told us.\n\nYess! I thought. My friends call me Kristy Thomas, the Idea Machine, and I guess the name fits. Instantly, I was thinking of a million ways Stoneybrook Middle School (otherwise known as SMS) could be improved.\n\nI raised my hand. \"Yes, Kristy?\" Ms. Garcia said.\n\n\"Is Mr. Taylor's job available?\"\n\n\"You want to be the principal?\" Ms. Garcia asked with a smile.\n\nThe class laughed. I was slightly embarrassed, but I just grinned and shrugged.\n\nWhat's wrong with wanting to be in charge? I couldn't think of anyone else in the eighth grade better equipped for the job. After all, I have experience in running things. I formed a softball team for little kids called Kristy's Krushers. And I'm founder and president of the Baby-sitters Club. I'll tell you more about that later, but for now let me say that the BSC (as we call it) is more than a club. It's a very successful business.\n\n\"I don't think the principal's job is open,\" Ms. Garcia said. \"But let me tell you how this is going to work.\"\n\nMs. Garcia went on to explain that any kid who was interested could volunteer to student teach. That would involve teaching in another class every other day for a week (three times total). We'd have to go through a teacher training course and submit prepared lesson plans, just like a real teacher does.\n\nA troubling thought hit me. Did I look enough like a teacher to control a class of SMS kids? For one thing, I'm only five feet tall, which makes me the smallest kid in my grade. And I don't look particularly sophisticated. No makeup. No jewelry. I wear my long brown hair plain and like no-fuss clothes such as jeans, sweatshirts, and sweaters.\n\nNaw, not a problem, I decided. Although I had never taken the place of an adult, I'd never, ever had trouble leading a group.\n\n\"You'll get to experience what we teachers go through,\" Ms. Garcia continued. \"Also, we hope some of you will be inspired to become teachers yourselves someday.\"\n\nA girl named Cokie Mason appeared at the door with some papers to give Ms. Garcia. She'd stood there long enough to hear what Ms. Garcia had been saying. \"Will TOT volunteers be dismissed from their regular classes those days?\" she asked as she handed Ms. Garcia the stack of papers.\n\nWell, duh. Cokie has never been a bright light, but this was a dumb question even for her. Did she really think she'd be expected to be in two places at once?\n\n\"You'll attend your regular classes except for the class periods when you are teaching another class,\" Ms. Garcia explained.\n\n\"Cool!\" Cokie said with a giggle as she left the room.\n\nI couldn't imagine being in a class taught by Cokie. I raised my hand and asked, \"Can anybody do this?\"\n\nMs. Garcia nodded. \"As long as you take the training course. Also, I should mention, those students who do volunteer will receive extra credit for their work.\"\n\nI was definitely going to volunteer. Even if I couldn't be principal, I had ideas about how some of my classes could be improved. For example, Ms. Griswold, my science teacher, tends to ignore a bunch of goof-off boys who sit in the back of the class. I'd make them work or get out. They distract everyone who sits near them. And Mrs. Simon, my English teacher, although she's very nice, picks the dullest things for us to read. I'd assign books that are much more enjoyable.\n\nI wondered which class I'd be assigned to. I was eager to know so I could start planning my lessons right away.\n\nIt was time to move on to my first period class. Before I left homeroom, I spoke to Ms. Garcia. \"I'd like to volunteer,\" I told her.\n\n\"You'll have to wait until Monday,\" she replied. \"We want to give students the weekend to think it over. We only want kids who are serious and who can give the project the time it requires.\"\n\n\"That makes sense,\" I agreed. \"All right. I'll sign up then.\"",

It's so much extra work!\"\n\n\"It's also extra credit,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"You get great grades. You don't need extra credit. You just want to boss kids around.\"\n\nAnd my friends say I'm too blunt.\n\n\"No, I don't!\" I objected. (Though I secretly wondered if there was a grain of truth to her comment.) A grin slowly spread across my face. \"I want to boss the teachers around.\"\n\n\"Oh, way to go,\" Abby said with a laugh. \"How do you expect to do that?\"\n\n\"I want to show them how they've been messing up in their classes. Show by example, I mean.\"\n\nAbby rolled her eyes. \"I don't know. It sounds like too much work to me.

And we're going S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G.\" Joanna Fried sang the letters of the last word as she, Shira Epstein, and Jeannie Kim swooped down on me.\n\nS-H-O-P-P-I-N-G. Two P's? Joanna would know better than I, the world's biggest enemy of the spelled word. Although you'd think I'd know how to spell one of my favorite activities.\n\n\"Earrings,\" said Jeannie, \"to go with this vest.\" She modeled her black velour vest, pointing out the red ribbon roses decorating the bottom edge. With her black jeans, black suede shoes, and long\u2011sleeved white shirt, it made a very cool outfit.\n\n\"Dangly red roses?\" I leaned forward to look at the vest a little more closely. If we found matching red ribbon, I might be able to make Jeannie some earrings. As I leaned over, I shrugged my overstuffed backpack to the ground. The sound of at least a hundred pounds of books hitting the floor made people turn around and look.\n\n\"It's not an earthquake,\" Joanna assured the crowd in the hallway, \"only Claudia's backpack.\"\n\nShira burst into giggles, which spread to the rest of us.\n\n\"What is in there?\" Jeannie asked. \"Explosives?\"\n\n\"Homework,\" I explained.\n\nShira stopped laughing, and her blue eyes grew to the size of small plates. \"Eighth grade means that much homework?\"\n\n\"It does for me,\" I said to my seventh\u2011grade friends. And they understood. They know me pretty well, even though we haven't been friends all that long. I'd been a year ahead of them in school until recently. And I'd always had to dog\u2011paddle like crazy just to keep my head above water in all my subjects \u2014 except art, which happens to be my best subject and my favorite. My teachers, parents, and counselors came up with a plan that involved my going back to seventh grade to catch up. I did and found out that school wasn't as hard as I'd thought. And, it wasn't long before I did so well that I was offered the chance to move back to eighth grade. I took it.",

          "text": "But not before I picked up an entire group of new friends, plus a boyfriend, Josh Rocker, who was walking toward us just then, as if my thoughts had summoned him.\n\nSuddenly I realized I had made plans to hang out with Josh. Somehow that had slipped my mind. \"Oh, wow,\" I exclaimed, \"I totally forgot!\" I knelt beside my bag and tried to stuff in one more book. No matter how I arranged and rearranged them, only four of the five I needed would fit.\n\n\"Totally forgot what?\" Josh knelt beside me and tugged on the book I was still holding. I let go, and he ended up sitting down unexpectedly in the middle of the hall. All of us, including Josh, laughed again. \"I was going to do that to you,\" he said, standing up and brushing off the seat of his jeans.\n\n\"I beat you to it.\" I smiled at him, glad to see him after a long day.\n\nJosh flashed me a grin and tucked my book under his arm. \"You ready?\"\n\nI looked at Jeannie, Joanna, and Shira standing on one side of me and Josh standing on the other. Then I looked at my watch and calculated how much time was left before I had to be at my Baby\u2011Sitters Club meeting \u2014 and came up with, well, not enough to shop with my friends, and hang out with Josh. The BSC meets at my house every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon at five\u2011thirty (more about this later). The club members are close friends of mine too. Sometimes I feel as though I need two or three more of me to be able to spend enough time with all my friends.\n\n\"Ready for what?\" Joanna asked.\n\nJosh looked from me to the girls, his smile fading. \"Claudia? We have plans, right?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"But you said you were going shopping with us!\" Shira said.\n\nI nodded again.\n\n\"No problem,\" said Joanna. \"You can come shopping with us, Josh.\" Joanna, who's super\u2011organized (she's president of the seventh\u2011grade class), always has an answer. She grabbed my math book out of my backpack and headed for the door.\n\nI turned to Josh, not saying anything but trying to communicate with my eyes how much I wanted him to say he'd go. He looked at the floor for a second, then nodded, the grin back in place. I felt like giving him a hug. And I knew he wouldn't mind going shopping with us. He did it all the time before we were boyfriend and girlfriend. He likes Joanna, Shira, and Jeannie as much as I do.\n\nMy backpack with only three books in it was much easier to handle than my backpack with five books in it. I knew Mom, Dad, and my sister, Janine, had plans for working with me this weekend. Studying and my homework had been a pretty important part of our family life since I returned to the eighth grade. Academics really matter to my family. Dad is a partner in an investment firm in Stamford, Connecticut (a larger town than Stoneybrook, where we live). He can't wait until I study stocks and bonds, but for now he's a big help in social studies. Mom is the head librarian at the Stoneybrook Public Library and sometimes I think she knows about everything! Then there's Janine. She's sixteen and a junior at Stoneybrook High School, but she takes classes at Stoneybrook University. She lives for homework, her own as well as mine. It all seems to be pretty easy to her. She's a genius with the IQ to prove it.\n\nSometimes I look at them sitting around the table, talking about computers or astronomy or some book they've all read, and I wonder how I ended up in this family. We look like a family, though \u2014 a Japanese\u2011American family. And they're incredibly supportive of me.",

          "text": "was reading. You see, we'd agreed to start a mother-daughter reading group. The idea was, we'd pick a book and then both read it. Each week we'd sit together and discuss the chapters we'd read.\n\nWhen I'd finished reading, I walked to the dining room. \"Mom, what exactly are we doing for Thanksgiving dinner this year?\" I asked.\n\nShe looked up blankly from the dish she'd been inspecting. I noticed a hairline crack across the middle. \"I'm sorry, what did you say?\" she asked.\n\n\"Thanksgiving,\" I repeated. \"What are we doing?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" she admitted. Before Mom and Dad were divorced, they always invited friends to dinner. (Most of our family lives too far away to visit.) But since the divorce, Mom has pretty much drifted away from the couples she and Dad used to hang out with. Besides, most of them are in New York City, where Dad still lives. But Mom and I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. Although it's less than two hours from the city, it feels farther away. That may be because it's so quiet and suburban \u2014 so completely different from the city. It's enough of a distance to make us both lose track of most of our old friends.\n\nI have two advantages over Mom, though. The first major plus is that I've made amazing new friends. We're all part of a group called the Baby\u2011sitters Club. (I'll tell you more about that later.)\n\nSecond, I still travel to the city on a regular basis to visit Dad. You could say I lead a double life. I'm part suburban Stoneybrooker and part city girl. My boyfriend, Ethan, lives in the city too, so I have lots of reasons to want to get into New York as much as I can.\n\nMom, though, almost never goes into the city. She's too busy with her job as a buyer for Bellair's Department Store, which is here in Stoneybrook. (A buyer is someone who selects the things the store is going to sell to its customers.) She says there's no reason for her to go to the city, except when she has to go to Manhattan for work.\n\nI argue that there are museums, plays, movies \u2014 a zillion other reasons for her to go. She just shrugs and says everything comes to Stamford eventually. (Stamford is the city closest to Stoneybrook.) I always shriek, \"Stamford! How can you compare Stamford to New York City?\" No offense to Stamford, but it is not an international center of culture and business like Manhattan.\n\nMom laughs and says she spent her whole life in New York City, and now she's happy to live at a slower pace.\n\nOkay, I can accept that. But what I don't understand is why she hasn't made many friends. \"Adults don't make new friends the way young people do,\" she insists. \"Besides, I'm too busy right now for new friendships.\"\n\nThat sounds like a pretty lame excuse. Yes, she's got a job, but she's not a workaholic like my dad. He's a lawyer and he lives and breathes his job. Mom doesn't do that \u2014 thank goodness. And it's not as if she has eight kids or something. There's only me.\n\nOf course, it's none of my business. Mom can live her life any way she chooses. I just think she must be lonely. Who wouldn't be?\n\nMom hasn't had a single date since the divorce. My dad already has a new steady girlfriend, Samantha. I'm not eager for a stepdad, but it would be nice for Mom if she went out once in awhile.\n\nSure, she's got me, and we're extremely close. Closer, I think, than most mothers and daughters. But I'm thirteen. Doesn't she want adult friends too? I mean, I love her \u2014 totally \u2014 but I wouldn't want to spend all my free time with her.\n\n\"I'll think about Thanksgiving later,\" she said, putting down the cracked dish. \"It's almost three weeks away, after all.\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" I agreed. \"Let's talk about the book.\"",

          "text": "We went to the living room and sat on the couch. I plucked a carrot stick from a plate on the coffee table. It was my midafternoon snack. Mom waited patiently for me to finish it. She knows I can't let myself get hungry because I have a chronic (meaning, never\u2011ending) condition called diabetes.\n\nA diabetic can't properly regulate the amount of sugar in his or her bloodstream. This happens automatically for most people. In my case, I have to give myself daily injections of something called insulin. I also have to eat only healthy foods, no sweets or junk food. And, as I said, I can't skip meals or let myself get hungry.\n\nNot paying attention to these things could be a majorly big deal. (I'm talking coma or even death.) But if I do what I'm supposed to do, it's not a problem. By now, it's become second nature for me to eat right and take my injections. I hardly even notice it.\n\nWhen I'd finished munching, Mom sat forward on the couch. \"So? What do you think of the book so far?\" she asked.\n\n\"It's good,\" I admitted. \"Elizabeth is pretty cool.\" Elizabeth Bennett is the main character and not at all what you'd expect from a young woman from that era. I thought she'd be prim and proper. But she's outspoken and witty, even mischievous, in a way.\n\n\"I think her independence shows that she's brave,\" Mom said. \"When you consider how little opportunity there was for women in those days, it takes real guts to stand on her own the way she does.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I agreed. \"You have to admire someone who would rather be poor than degrade herself by trying to snare a rich husband.\"\n\nMom nodded. \"Especially when that was what all the women around her were doing. It shows a lot of self\u2011respect and pride.\"\n\n\"Maybe too much pride,\" I suggested as an idea came to me.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Mom asked.\n\n\"Well ... she's so proud that she assumes Mr. Darcy is looking down on her because she's poor. But she doesn't really know that to be true. She snubs him before he can snub her. Isn't that reverse snobbery? Shouldn't she at least give him a chance?\"\n\n\"You have a point,\" Mom said. \"I can understand how she would feel defensive, though. Mr. Darcy is so wealthy. All the women are after him. She's not about to join the crowd.\"\n\n\"I'm glad I wasn't born back then,\" I said. \"What if no one wanted to marry me? There would be nothing el",

From there, she flopped on her back and covered her face with her hands.\n\n\"Tell me what to do, Mary Anne,\" she pleaded. \"I don't know. I don't know.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you,\" I protested. I was sitting on the floor with her youngest sister, five\u2011year\u2011old Claire, cutting strips of red construction paper so we could make paper Christmas tree chains.\n\nThat December day, Mallory and I were baby\u2011sitting for Claire and the rest of the Pike kids. The job required the two of us, because Mallory has seven brothers and sisters. We'd be sitting for them a lot over the next few weeks, because Mrs. Pike had taken a temporary full\u2011time job as a salesperson in Bellair's department store. It was just for the holiday season.\n\n\"I could tell you not to go,\" I added, \"but that would be selfish. You have to do what you think is right.\"\n\nMallory was waiting to find out if she'd been accepted to Riverbend Hall, a boarding school in Massachusetts. She's eleven. I think eleven is too young to live away from home. I'm thirteen, and even that's too young, in my opinion. Besides, I didn't want her to leave. Mallory is a good friend. And the Baby\u2011sitters Club wouldn't be the same without her.\n\nWhat is the BSC? It's a group of good friends who run a baby\u2011sitting business. Mallory and I are both members.\n\n\"Jessi told me not to go,\" Mallory said.\n\n\"Okay, but she has her own reasons for that,\" I pointed out. \"She's your best friend, all\u2026\"\n\n\"Where are you going, Mallory?\" Claire asked.\n\n\"Uh \u2026 nowhere yet. Maybe to the mall,\" Mallory said vaguely.\n\n\"I love the mall,\" Claire said. \"Santa's there now. You should go.\"\n\n\"Claire, could you get some more colored paper, please?\" I asked. \"It's on the kitchen table.\" I watched Claire scamper off, then turned back to Mallory. \"Why didn't you tell her what we were talking about?\"\n\nMallory shrugged. \"She's too little. I've talked to Vanessa about it,\" she said. (Vanessa is her nine\u2011year\u2011old sister.) \"And the others know. But Mom and Dad said not to discuss it too much until we find out whether I've been accepted.

          "text": "It had started a couple of months ago, when SMS sponsored a program in which the students took over as teachers. Mallory was assigned to teach an English class, which was perfect. She's a gifted writer, and she loves literature and poetry. No problem, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nMal was assigned to an eighth\u2011grade English class, which was pretty intimidating for a sixth\u2011grader.\n\nMy friend Kristy Thomas and I were in that class. We tried to be supportive, but things went wrong from the start. Mallory was nervous, and as soon as some of the kids saw what an easy target she was, they began teasing her.\n\nDuring one of the classes, while Mallory was writing on the board, the chalk flew out of her hand and rocketed across the room. Because of that, one kid labeled her Spaz Girl. The name stuck. And since then, some obnoxious kids have decided it's hysterically funny to bump into Mallory, to write stupid things on her locker, and generally to make her life miserable. It is incredibly unfair, because Mallory is one of the nicest people you could ever want to know.\n\nBefore all this started, Mallory loved school, but now she dreads it. Her grades have fallen. And she hardly ever smiles or laughs. The change in her makes me want to cry.\n\nStill, Mallory managed to take some action. She began doing research, looking for other schools she might be able to attend. She found Riverbend Hall on the Internet and wrote to them, asking for more information. Last month, she and her parents took a weekend trip to check it out. She really liked it, and her parents approved, so she applied.\n\n\"It also depends on whether I get a scholarship,\" Mallory continued, sitting up on the couch. \"There's no way my parents can afford the tuition. The people at Riverbend were impressed with my writing, though. And they do have a writing scholarship.\"\n\n\"I bet you'll win it,\" I said, not sounding as happy and encouraging as maybe I should have. I have to admit, I didn't want her to win the scholarship. I know \u2014 if it was what she wanted, then I should have wanted it for her. But I didn't want her to leave. Besides, she wasn't sure if she wanted to go anyway.",

And hopefully to stay through high school. I was excited, and terrified, and happy, and sad \u2014 a big tangle of emotions.\n\nSee, I've lived all eleven years of my life in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I love the nine other members of my family (I have seven siblings!), and I have the best friends anyone could imagine. Including Jessi Ramsey, my very best friend. (She and I are junior members of the Baby\u2011sitters Club, or BSC. More about that later.)\n\nIt wasn't going to be easy to leave my home and family and friends, but I'd thought over my decision for a long time, and I was as sure as I possibly could be that I was doing the right thing.\n\nIt was Thursday night, and quiet in the Pike house for a change. My parents had taken my brothers and sisters to the movies in order to give me some time on my own. I'd been packing all day and I was worn\u2011out. It wasn't easy to decide what to take with me, and it definitely wasn't easy to fit everything into one big trunk and a small suitcase.\n\nFinally, I decided I'd done enough for one day. I plopped down on my bed and pulled out my journal from under my mattress.\n\nWriting in my journal is essential to me. It's something I do nearly every day, and it's almost as if the day isn't complete until I've recorded my thoughts and feelings about what's happened. I've always loved to write. In fact, I plan to be a writer when I grow up \u2014 a writer and illustrator of children's books, to be exact. (I love to draw too.)",

I'm going to barf if he doesn't quit.\"\n\n\"Go, Nicky! Show her more!\"\n\nAh, yes. A family dinner, Pike\u2011style. That was the first thing I imagined. And so far, nothing much had changed. Nicky, who's eight, was doing his best to gross everyone out. Margo, the one who said she'd barf, is seven. She's always had a weak stomach. And who was encouraging Nicky? Adam, of course. He's one of the triplets, my ten\u2011year\u2011old brothers. Jordan and Byron are the other two. In my daydream, Byron was playing with a long strand of spaghetti, sucking it in and squirting it back out, sucking it in again and squirting it out. Jordan was counting as he watched. \"Eight, nine, ten! You're going for a world record, man!\" he said, pounding Byron on the back.\n\n\"Ew,\" said Claire, my youngest sibling. She's five. \"Boys are so gross. Spaghetti is for eating, you silly\u2011billy\u2011goo\u2011goo Byron!\" She sucked in her own strand of spaghetti so fast that tomato sauce splashed on her face.\n\n\"What rhymes with spaghetti?\" my sister Vanessa asked as she dreamily twirled a few strands around her fork. \"Petty? Letty?\" she tried. \"That's a tough one.\" Vanessa, who's nine, wants to be a poet. She loves to think up rhymes.\n\nMy mom and dad were basically ignoring the whole scene. Oh, they threw in an occasional \"Use your napkin, Claire,\" or \"Chew with your mouth closed, Nicky,\" but mostly they tried to act as if this were a civilized dinner with civilized people, just as they've always done.\n\nIt's a losing battle.\n\nBut I could have helped. I would have wiped Claire's face and helped to cut up her spaghetti so she wouldn't have made such a mess of herself. I would have offered several rhymes to Vanessa (\"Betty\" came to mind), distracted Margo so Nicky would have no reason to show off and Adam would have no reason to egg him on. And I would have informed Byron that he was nowhere near creating a world's record. (The spaghetti\u2011sucking record was set years ago by my friend Kristy's brother Sam, who did it twenty\u2011seven times.)\n\nMy family. There they were, all of them around the table. Nine Pikes, all with brown hair and blue eyes. I'm the only one who doesn't quite match, since my hair is reddish\u2011brown and much curlier than anyone else's. Vanessa and Nicky wear glasses, like I do (I'm dying for contacts, but my parents say I have to wait until I'm fifteen), but nobody else wears braces (yuck).\n\nThere wasn't even an empty chair for me; instead they'd put mine away and spread out so everyone had a little more space. I couldn't blame them. In a family as big as ours, we're always looking for more space.\n\nSuddenly, in my daydream, Byron looked up at my dad. \"I wonder what Mal's doing right now,\" he said thoughtfully.\n\n\"Having a nice, quiet dinner, probably,\" my dad answered jokingly.\n\n\"I miss Mal,\" said Claire. \"When will she be back?\"\n\n\"Not for a while,\" said my mom, patting Claire's hand. \"And I miss her too. We all do.\" She looked sad.\n\n\"Right,\" said Nicky. \"So, can I have her dessert tonight?\"\n\nI burst out laughing. My daydream had seemed so real. I knew that's just how it would be. My family would miss me, but they'd go on as they always had.",

You want to show some real heart, close school for the day. When Kristy Thomas, our fearless leader and president of the Baby-sitters Club (also known as the BSC \u2014 more about that later), runs for President of the United States, I'm going to suggest that as one of the planks in her platform. As it is, Valentine's Day is just an excuse for candy and universal silliness. The candy I don't mind, but the silliness I could live without. When I realized February 14th was almost upon us, I hoped Stoneybrook Middle School, or SMS, would not descend into valentine madness the way my school on Long Island did. But I quickly learned that the red-heart syndrome infested Connecticut as well as New York. At least two weeks before the date, the memos on the bulletin board next to the principal's office appeared on red paper (including a memo about the school's Valentine Day's Dance, on red paper cut into a heart shape, in case we missed the point). Teachers began to decorate their classrooms with paper heart chains strung from one end of the room to the other. Really fanatic teachers even taught about Valentine's Day. Dolly One (one of two teachers at SMS with more than a passing resemblance to Dolly Parton), also known as Mrs. Bernhardt, my history teacher, gave us a little lesson on Saint Valentine, who may or may not have been a mythical figure. Mythical or not, he clearly had some influence in Stoneybrook. I briefly considered volunteering to do an extra-credit report for Dolly One, exploding the whole Valentine's Day myth and revealing it for the overly sentimental, overly celebrated advertising campaign that it really is. But who wants to be a Valentine Scrooge? Not even I, Abigail Stevenson of Stoneybrook, Connecticut.",

You know what happened next, don't you? You're right. I ate the whole box. Mom and Dad found out because by dinner that night I had a major stomachache. They thought it was pretty funny. My father said, \"Abby, next time save a little to share with the rest of us.\" But Anna was furious with me for weeks, even when I paid back her half of the money we'd used to buy the candy. And let her have the heart-shaped box. That kind of candy, in a heart-shaped box, is still my favorite.",

          "text": "So you can see that Valentine's Day and I are not made for each other. I do not want a BF (boyfriend). I do not want to play kissyface in the halls the way some people do. Although some people (Mary Anne Spier, the secretary of the BSC, for instance) are dating genuinely nice, mature guys who don't say gross or stupid things and are fun to hang around with, I have noticed that most guys my age are, well, a little immature. So, while BFs are fine in theory \u2014 especially if, like Mary Anne and her BF, Logan, you truly enjoy each other's company \u2014 I've decided to wait on the whole deal, to give the guys a chance to grow up a little. Meanwhile, I have plenty to do. I have athletics, including soccer, only the most perfect sport in the world (INVENTED BY MEN, PERFECTED BY WOMEN, as one of my favorite T-shirts says). I am a member of the aforementioned Baby-sitters Club, which means I do a lot of baby-sitting. I have schoolwork, which, since I am an average student, keeps me on my toes. And, of course, I have my family and my allergies and my asthma. Allergies? Asthma? How can such things keep you busy? Easy, when life makes you sneeze. I travel with an inhaler in case I have an asthma attack. And I have to be careful because a bad attack could send me to the hospital (it's happened a couple of times). I'm planning on outgrowing all this, but meanwhile I am allergic to cat litter, milk, shellfish, and probably dozens of things I don't even know about yet. Which brings us back to February and V-day. The one good thing about the day is that it falls during a month when pollen doesn't plug the air, when the pollution count is generally low, and when the things that make me sneeze do not rule (at least, not so much). It means that I can wear my contacts instead of my glasses because I don't have to deal with watery eyes. It means that I can smell things (chocolate, not flowers). So as long as no one sends me any valentine flowers, I'm willing to admit that the day has a good point. I was thinking about all these things as I slammed my locker at the end of that Wednesday, not quite two weeks before V-day, and paused to admire its un-valentine decorated surface.",

A small V-shaped wrinkle had formed in the center of his forehead and \u2014 without his realizing it \u2014 the tip of his tongue had crept out of the corner of his mouth.\n\nIn the months that we'd been going out, I'd come to learn that this adorable expression meant Josh Rocker was concentrating very hard on what he was doing. Unfortunately, I could also see that all his concern and thought hadn't prevented a big problem.\n\nAs if he sensed that I was watching him, Josh looked up. \"What?\" he asked, suddenly self\u2011conscious.\n\n\"Sorry to mention this,\" I began, shifting uncomfortably in my director's chair, \"but I think there might be a problem with the shirt you're sewing.\"\n\n\"There is?\" he asked doubtfully, holding the shirt out in front of him. It was a white T\u2011shirt with a basketball\u2011shaped badge in the right\u2011hand corner. On the badge were the letters GSBA, which stands for Girls' Stoneybrook Basketball Association. GSBA is a local group of neighborhood girls here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, who were inspired by the Women's National Basketball Association to start their own basketball league.\n\nThe girls involved are younger than my friends and me, who are in middle school. But we'd volunteered to help out, so I was decorating uniforms and Josh was helping me. We were getting started this afternoon by sewing on the badges I'd ordered from a print shop in downtown Stoneybrook.\n\n\"I think you've stitched the two sides of the shirt together,\" I said gently.\n\n\"No way,\" Josh protested, running his hand up the middle of the shirt. \"Oops,\" he said with a quick grimace. Then he blushed slightly, the red spreading around his cheeks. (So cute.)\n\n\"That's okay.\" I reached behind me and took a pair of scissors from my desk. \"Just snip it out and start again.\"\n\nRolling his eyes, Josh took the scissors from me.",

Josh and I couldn't help but smile at the way she talks like a brainiac, as if she's playing the part of a genius on a TV show.\n\nWe also smiled because we knew Janine was just pretending to care if we needed help. She was actually looking for an excuse to keep a close eye on Josh and me.\n\nMy parents expect Janine to be in charge when they're out. She takes that responsibility very seriously. And I know her well enough to be sure that my being alone with Josh was making her nervous\n\n\"Thanks, Janine, but we're fine,\" I assured her.\n\n\"That's excellent,\" she said. \"If you need anything, I'll be in my room working on my calculus assignment.\" As she left, I noticed she pushed my door open even farther and left it that way.\n\nI smiled to myself as I went back to my own sewing.",

It's not that I hate them \u2014 I just don't care about them. What I do love is art. Painting, sculpting, jewelry making, printmaking, you name it.

I have brown hair and brown eyes and I'm on the short side. I'm crazy about kids, and I love to baby\u2011sit, which is why I belong to the coolest club in Stoneybrook: the Baby\u2011sitters Club, or BSC, but more about that later. For now, those are my vital statistics. Except for one more: I \u2665 baseball. And softball. Softball is just another form of baseball, as I always see it. They\u2019re different games \u2014 but the same too. As long as there are bats and balls and bases involved, I\u2019m in heaven.\n\nI have always adored baseball. I learned to play when I was even younger than Karen is now. My dad taught me the basics, and I guess I\u2019ll always have that to thank him for.\n\nMy dad doesn\u2019t live with us. He hasn\u2019t for a long, long time. He walked out on my family years ago, when David Michael was just a baby. And ever since then, he\u2019s been pretty much out of my life. Oh, he sends a card once in awhile, on my birthday or at Christmas, but that\u2019s about it.\n\nDo I miss him?\n\nSort of. I used to miss him a lot more, but my memories of him are fading. I do think of him occasionally, though, especially when I make a great hit or a sweet catch out there on the ball field.\n\nI used to miss having a dad (a \"father figure,\" as the school counselor would probably say), but now I have a wonderful stepdad. His name is Watson Brewer. He\u2019s funny, kind, and sweet. (Handsome? Hmmm. Well, sure, if you happen to like the balding type.) Anyway, he\u2019s an excellent husband for my mom.\n\nHe also happens to be a millionaire.\n\nWhich means that I live in a mansion.\n\nYup, it\u2019s true. When my mom married Watson, we all moved across town to share his house. Which is huge. And that\u2019s lucky, because our family is huge too. Apart from David Michael and Karen, there are my two older brothers, Charlie and Sam (Charlie is seventeen, Sam is fifteen); Karen\u2019s younger brother, Andrew, who\u2019s four (Karen and Andrew are Watson\u2019s children from his first marriage; they live with us every other month); and Emily Michelle, who\u2019s just a toddler. She was a Vietnamese orphan who joined our family when my mom and Watson decided to adopt a baby together.\n\nThere\u2019s also Nannie, my grandmother. She\u2019s my mom\u2019s mom. She came to live with us soon after Emily Michelle arrived.\n\nWe also have a whole menagerie of pets.\n\nIs my household chaotic? Definitely.\n\nDo I love it? Absolutely.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t trade with anyone else, even though there are moments when I\u2019d give twenty bucks for twenty seconds of silence.\n\nFor the most part, though, silence is not my thing. I like noise and activity and crowds. So my family suits me.",

Now he wound up and tossed it gently to Andrew.\n\nDavid Michael is a good kid. He has dark brown hair (darker than mine), which is a little curly (mine is straighter). We really look alike. In fact, we practically dress like twins. Yes, it\u2019s true. I dress like a seven\u2011year\u2011old boy. Except for the Spider\u2011Man underwear. All I ever wear are jeans, a T\u2011shirt, and sneakers. And sometimes David Michael and I even wear the same T\u2011shirt. For instance, on that day we were both wearing our Krushers shirts.\n\n\"Kistee!\" Emily Michelle called out my name. She toddled toward me, carrying the softball in both hands. Andrew had tossed it to her, including her in our game. \"Ball!\" she exclaimed, giving me a huge smile.\n\n\"That\u2019s right,\" I said. \"Ball.\" She handed it to me, beaming. Emily Michelle is adorable. She has shiny black eyes and shiny black hair to match. She\u2019s a very important part of our family. It took her awhile to start speaking English, and she still doesn\u2019t speak as well as most two\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half\u2011year\u2011olds. (She\u2019s what the specialists call \"language delayed.\") But she\u2019s a very happy girl, and we all love her.\n\nI knelt down to give her a big hug.\n\nImmediately, Andrew and Karen and David Michael piled on top of us. \"Group hug!\" yelled Karen as she threw her arms around my neck.",

Sometimes I use drills I learned from my dad, or from Coach Wu, the coach of my school softball team, and sometimes I just make up my own.

She\u2019s pretty serious. But she\u2019s a great coach, and I was looking forward to spending the coming season on her team.

Stacey ... everyone is staring at you,\" she pointed out.\n\nGlancing around the Stoneybrook Middle School hallway, I saw she was telling the truth. I guess my announcer's voice had been louder than I realized.\n\nCringing, I covered my red face with my hand. \"Oops,\" I said.\n\nEmily Bernstein had been part of my audience. She's a friend of Abby's and mine. \"A little excited about the film class, Stacey?\" she asked.\n\n\"Just a little,\" I replied, lowering my hand.\n\n\"How could you tell?\" asked Abby.\n\nEmily shut her locker. \"A wild guess,\" she said with a laugh. \"I signed up for the film class too. I'll see you later.\" With a wave, she walked down the hall.\n\nI turned back to Abby. \"Now that I've made an idiot of myself, let's get to class.\"\n\n\"If you're going to be in film, you have to get used to being in the public eye,\" said Abby as we started to walk down the hall together.\n\n\"But I want to direct,\" I explained. \"I don't want to be a star.\"\n\n\"How about a model?\" asked Abby.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I replied. \"But no.\" People have told me before that I should think about modeling or acting. I've tried both. Modeling and acting are fun but hard work. And neither one interested me enough to consider as a career.\n\nBut I do like to watch movies and figure out how they might have been improved. To be honest, I'm just plain wild about movies in general. I love old movies, new ones, art films, and big blockbuster adventures. I suppose you might say I'm a movie maniac. So I thought I might be able to direct. \"Acting seems glamorous, but directing sounds more challenging,\" I explained.\n\n\"If you were a director, you'd still have to appear at movie premieres and do interviews and stuff like that,\" Abby reminded me.\n\n\"True. Though I don't think there will be a lot of media coverage of a film class being offered at a middle school in Stoneybrook, Connecticut.\" I didn't care, though. Just having a chance to be in this Short Takes class was exciting enough. How many other thirteen-year-olds get to have that experience? Not many.\n\nShort Takes are mini-courses that run for only three weeks at Stoneybrook Middle School, otherwise known as SMS.",

(I lived in Manhattan until that year.) Our parents were eating in an outdoor caf\u00e9 halfway up the block, but Laine and I kept running down the street to watch the movie being filmed.\n\nThe street had been blocked off with wooden sawhorses. Big trailers lined both sides of the street, and huge lights on poles had been mounted everywhere.\n\nLaine and I sneaked past the sawhorses and stood between two trailers to watch. It was amazing to see actors I recognized standing around, waiting for their scenes. Some rehearsed their lines. Others talked to the director. Like real people!\n\nSomeone turned on a rain machine and the actors walked into the fake rain, getting soaked. The man and woman were supposed to be so in love that they didn't mind walking in the rain.\n\nLaine and I laughed as the water blew our way. But we didn't move from our hiding spot between the trailers. We were too excited to care about getting wet.\n\nSince movies are always being filmed in New York City, our parents took it for granted. But for Laine and me, that day was magical.\n\nThat was one of the last exciting things I did with Laine, because not too long after that my family moved here to Stoneybrook.\"",

I can't pretend that Teenzine is especially deep. But just then, it was exactly what I wanted to be reading. After all, it was a warm June afternoon. School had ended for the summer, and I was due for some relaxation.

I go to Stoneybrook Middle School (SMS), where I make above\u2011average \u2014 but not perfect \u2014 grades. I have brown eyes and chin\u2011length brown hair and I'm one of the shortest girls in the eighth grade. I'm not a supertrendy dresser (I'd never wear most of the wild stuff they show in Teenzine), but I do manage to look presentable. My style is preppy\u2011but\u2011casual. I like to look neat; no dreadlocks or huge baggy jeans for me. And my ears aren't even pierced, much less my nose or my belly button.\n\nOne of the models in Teenzine has, like, everything pierced. Plus, she has about six tattoos. Um, no thanks.\n\nI think my dad is happy I turned out the way I did. He brought me up all by himself, since my mom died when I was just a baby. I don't remember her at all. Sometimes I stare at the pictures I have of her, hoping for some distant memory to pop into my brain. But that hasn't happened yet.\n\nAnyway, my dad did his best to be both father and mother to me. And except for a brief time right after my mom died, when he was just too sad to cope and he sent me to live with my grandparents, he has always been up to the job. In fact, for a while he tried a little too hard to be good at parenting. He was extremely strict. My friends couldn't believe how he controlled my life. He chose the clothes I wore (mostly little\u2011girl dresses, even when I was in seventh grade), my hairstyle (braids, which went well with those dresses), and even my bedspread and posters (my room looked like an eight\u2011year\u2011old's). But as I matured and he loosened up a bit, he gave me more and more independence. I started to pick out my own clothes, do my hair the way I wanted, and decorate my room with things I'd picked out myself.\n\nMy dad's been fine with all my choices. (Who knows how he would react if I wanted to dye my hair pink, though!) He even approves of the fact that I have a boyfriend. Fortunately, Logan Bruno is the kind of boy any dad would like.\"",

Logan also happens to have this great Southern accent, left over from when he lived in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThere was a feature on Cam in Teenzine. I had already cut out the best picture \u2014 one in which he was playing with his dog on the beach \u2014 to add to my Cam Geary collage. Under the picture was a quote about how the dog was his best friend. It was so sweet it almost made me cry.\"",

I'm proud to say it was totally my idea, even though the four of us worked it out together. \"Us\" is Mary Anne Spier, Claudia Kishi, Stacey McGill, and me \u2014 Kristy Thomas. But that was at the beginning of seventh grade, after the summer in which my friendship with Claudia nearly fell apart, Mary Anne began to find out who she was, Claudia experienced her first love, and an unhappy girl left New York City and moved to our town. It was quite a summer.\n\nWhen Mary Anne and Claudia and Stacey and I talked about it later (when we were older), we discovered that during those long hot months we had all, separately, felt that we didn't quite belong where we were. Not one of us. Up until that summer we hadn't paid much attention to such things. But now Mary Anne felt that she was suddenly teetering between childhood and teenagehood, or whatever you call it, and that she didn't fit into either world. Claudia felt that she was drifting away from Mary Anne and me, drifting toward her own teenagehood alone \u2014 while Mary Anne and I lingered on the shore. Stacey had survived a horrible year and had been shunned by her classmates and friends, and now her parents had decided to move the family here to Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where she knew absolutely no one. And I, Kristin Amanda Thomas, felt like a stranger in my family. I would look around at my mom and my brothers, who were oh-so-happy with Mom's new boyfriend, Watson, and I'd think, How can they leave Dad behind? Am I the only one who still wants him to be part of the family? And so I decided to give my father a second chance.\n\nThe summer started off like most of the other summers of my life. But by the end of it, everything was different. We were different. And the summer brought the four of us, Claudia, Stacey, Mary Anne, and me, together to form the Baby\u2011sitters Club \u2014 something we would belong to, in one sense or another, for the rest of our lives.",

I had cleaned out my locker early that morning before school began \u2014 and I mean really cleaned it. With a tiny bottle of Fantastik and a bunch of paper towels that I had stuffed into my backpack before I left home. I had removed every last scrap of paper from the locker, every old eraser, every gum wrapper and paper clip and pencil stub, plus one gray sock, and thrown them away (including the sock, which smelled). Then I had scrubbed the locker down with the Fantastik. I wasn't taking any chances on being called at home in a day or two about the condition of my locker. I did not want to have to set foot in Stoneybrook Middle School again until September, when seventh grade would begin. So when that last bell rang, I ran from my language arts class (calling a hasty and not at all heartfelt good\u2011bye over my shoulder to Mrs. Alpin, whom I loathed) directly to the front door of SMS, where I met Mary Anne, my best friend in the world. Mary Anne had also cleaned her locker thoroughly that morning, and the two of us had not one single school responsibility left.\n\nWe had to wait for Claudia, though. Claud had not thought quite as far ahead as we had, and she still had to deal with her locker and also have a chat with her math teacher, whose class she had not exactly flunked but hadn't quite passed, either. These were Claud's words, and while they didn't make sense to me, I didn't care. School was out!\n\n\"You know what my grandmother used to shout on the last day of school?\" I said to Mary Anne as we waited, lolling against the door frame and watching kids stream past us, calling and hooting.\n\n\"No. What?\" I could tell that Mary Anne was impatient for Claudia to show up.\n\n\"She used to shout, 'School's out! School's out! Teacher wore her bloomers out!' \"\n\nMary Anne stared at me. \"What does that mean?\" she said finally.\n\n\"Well, how should I know? It just sounds funny.\"\n\nMary Anne twirled the end of one brown braid thoughtfully around her finger. \"Maybe \u2014\" she started to say.\n\nBut I interrupted her. \"There's Claudia.\"\n\nMary Anne turned around and we saw Claud coming toward us through the crowded corridor at a pace ordinarily reserved for snails and turtles. She was walking arm in arm with Dori Wallingford. Howie Johnson and Pete Black were flanking them.\n\n\"Dori,\" Mary Anne muttered.\n\n\"Boys,\" I muttered.\n\nClaudia and Mary Anne and I used to sit together at lunch sometimes, but that had changed between our winter break and our spring break. Dori and several other girls who were more interested in clothes than in practically anything else had suddenly become more interesting to Claudia than Mary Anne and me or practically anyone else. Except boys.\n\nClaudia waved cheerfully to her new friends. \"See you!\" she called as Dori and Howie and Pete crossed the lawn to the line of waiting school buses. \"Hi, you guys,\" she said to Mary Anne and me, and for an instant I felt like something hanging on the Reduced rack at Bellair's Department Store.\n\n\"Hey, Claud,\" said Mary Anne as we began our walk to Bradford Court, \"what do you think 'Teacher wore her bloomers out' means?\"\n\nClaud shrugged and snapped her gum.\n\nMary Anne tried again. \"So, what are you guys doing this afternoon?\"\n\nNow Claudia answered in an instant. \"Nothing. Wonderful, glorious nothing. That is the beauty of no homework.\" She paused, then added thoughtfully, \"Well, not really nothing. I think I'll paint.\"\n\n\"I'm baby\u2011sitting for David Michael,\" I said. David Michael was my six\u2011year\u2011old brother. My big brothers (Charlie, who was sixteen, and Sam, who was fourteen) and I took turns watching him when school was out. While our mom had a great job at a company in Stamford, the salary wasn't enough to support four children and a nanny. Our parents were divorced and Dad, who had remarried and lived all the way across the country in California, sent money when he felt like it. The temporary jobs he got didn't pay much, so Mom always said, \"You can't squeeze blood out o",

It turns out that this is an appropriate day to start a new journal, since I feel like one part of my life has ended (way too abruptly), and a new and very scary one has suddenly begun. But the new, scary part didn\u2019t start until the end of school, so I\u2019ll get to that in a minute. I want to back up first and record yesterday, which was when everything really began. It started off normally. There was no sign of what was to come\u2014no dark skies or weird violin music.\n\nI woke up thinking about friends\u2014my friends, and friends in general. Sometimes I just don\u2019t understand friends. Like, why do they have to change all the time? Something is going on with every single one of my good friends, and I don\u2019t like any of it. They\u2019re probably writing about me right now in their journals. They\u2019re saying that Dawn Schafer should just settle down and not get so distracted by school. Well, I can\u2019t help getting distracted. I mean, just this morning, for instance, I was thinking about what I don\u2019t like about eighth grade. It\u2019s really been bothering me. Okay, so Vista is divided into those three main buildings. The biggest one is the high school building for grades nine, ten, eleven, and twelve. The middle-sized one is for preschool through grade four, and the smallest one is mine, the middle school building, for grades five through eight. Well, my building is soooo crowded this year. Suddenly there isn\u2019t enough space for us all. There are about a thousand kids in each class, and there aren\u2019t even enough rooms for us. My math class is held in the gym\u2014on Tuesdays and Fridays. On the other days it\u2019s held in the back of the auditorium, while an English class meets in the front. It\u2019s a mess and I hate it. No wonder I\u2019m distracted by school. I can\u2019t concentrate or settle down.\n\nSee? Just thinking about school made me get off track. I was talking about my friends, then \u2026 poof.\n\nMaybe\u2014maybe\u2014what was announced today will be for the better. But I\u2019m not holding my breath.\n\nAnyway\u2026 back to yesterday morning.",

          "text": "As always, I walked to Vista with Sunny and Maggie. I left crabby Jeff behind, glad he was going to walk to school with his dorky friends. First I went next door and stood outside Sunny\u2019s house. In the old days I used to barge up the walk to her front door and ring the bell. Sometimes I\u2019d even go inside without ringing. I knew Sunny and her parents would just be eating their breakfast. Now I never know what to do. Or at any rate, I don\u2019t know what to do during those times Mrs. Winslow is home from the hospital. Like, if I ring the bell will I wake her up? Do they want me to come in or do they need as much private family time as they can get?\n\nI was standing at the bottom of the front stoop, feeling like a jerk, when the door burst open and Sunny barreled outside.\n\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go,\u201d she said.\n\nI noticed she was holding a bag of granola. \u201cDidn\u2019t you eat breakfast?\u201d I asked her. \u201cYou can eat first. We don\u2019t have to rush.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll eat on the way to school. Mom\u2019s having a horrible morning. She\u2019s on chemo again and the drugs are making her sick.\u201d\n\nAt first I didn\u2019t say anything. I was thinking that if my mom were really sick, I\u2019d want to stay at home with her. Or at least not flee the house early in order to get away from her. Then I realized maybe that wasn\u2019t true. I mean, how do I know how I would react if Mom had lung cancer? Maybe I would do just what Sunny has been doing lately.\n\nSunny was practically running down the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cHey, wait!\u201d I called. \u201cSlow down.\u201d\n\nSunny slowed down. A little.\n\nWe turned a corner. I always feel the exact same way when I reach the end of our street and make that left onto Palm Boulevard. Like I\u2019ve stepped onto a movie set or something. Maybe it\u2019s because Palm is the unofficial divider of my middle\u2011class neighborhood and Maggie\u2019s definitely\u2011not\u2011middle\u2011class neighborhood. All those swimming pools and tennis courts. I feel uncomfortable. Like I shouldn\u2019t even be looking down those streets.\n\nYikes. My hand is getting tired. More later.",

          "text": "Friday, later on, 9/26\n\nVista may seem like a big mess to me right now, but there are some things I like about it very much. The journal idea is one of the best things about Vista. I bet most of the students are like me and would keep journals even if the teachers didn\u2019t require it. At least they would keep them by the time they left Vista\u2019s elementary building and moved into the middle school building. It seems to me that just around that time, around fifth and sixth grade, everything begins to happen. Suddenly life gets so complicated. I suppose that life always gets more complicated. I mean, the older you are, the more complicated it is. In kindergarten, for example, what do you have to worry about except whether your friend will share her crayons with you. It seems like such a big deal at the time. Then by third grade you have to worry about whether William Barton is going to kiss you on the playground, and it\u2019s enough to make you fake a stomachache so you can stay home from school. But you have no idea what\u2019s coming, what you\u2019ll be up against when you\u2019re ten, twelve, thirteen. For me, things heated up until they spun out of control when I was twelve. That was the year Mom and Dad got divorced, and Mom moved Jeff and me all the way across the country to Connecticut. We had to say good\u2011bye to California, to Vista, to everyone and everything. I thought my heart would break when I had to say good\u2011bye to Sunny. I truly didn\u2019t know how to say good\u2011bye to my best friend. Then Connecticut turned out to be cool, figuratively and literally. I made friends, Mom got remarried, and I acquired a stepfather and a stepsister, who already happened to be my Connecticut best friend. Then Jeff decided to move back to California, then I did too, and then Dad married Carol. Not exactly in that order. The point is that t",

Unfortunately.\n\nMiserable.\n\nHateful.\n\nPointless.\n\nSleepless.\n\nNight three of insomnia. I cannot believe it. The very last thing I need.\n\nI\u2019ve listened to all my CDs. I\u2019ve even tried doing homework, but that just made me even more depressed.\n\nI actually thought about calling Dawn. For about a second. Like, she would really be thrilled to hear me at this hour, complaining about the same old stuff.\n\nSo I\u2019ll just sit here and do something that would make my teachers faint.\n\nWrite. Voluntarily.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll bore myself to sleep.\n\nDawn used to say my name fit my personality. Sunny. The sunny Sunny Winslow.\n\nI hate that. It\u2019s so wrong.\n\nWell, it does feel better to write this out. These journals aren\u2019t such a stupid idea after all. Okay, let\u2019s hit all the problems, from the top.\n\nNumber one. I am very upset about Mom. Three days ago I told her to call Dr. Merwin about her wheezing. I didn\u2019t like the way she sounded. Of course, she waited until today, when she\u2019s really sick. So now she has to go back to the hospital for observation. Plus she has to stop chemotherapy and radiation treatments until she\u2019s better.\n\nNumber two. Dad. When the renovations in his store began, he became the Control Freak of the Century. This is his life now:\n\nMost of \u201cetc.\u201d is taken up with sleep.\n\nWhich Dad has no trouble with. I can hear him snoring in the next room. He sounds like wood shop. I don\u2019t know how Mom puts up with it. I don\u2019t know how I put up with it.\n\nI\u2019ll just stay awake, that\u2019s all. At school tomorrow I\u2019ll look like a horror movie. Sunny the undead. Maggie and Dawn will give me more useless insomnia tips.\n\nLike today. Maggie suggested I should look out the window and pick out constellations. Well, I don\u2019t know how many stars she can see through the Palo City smog. The ones I saw all looked like the Big Dipper.\n\nDawn? She had insomnia too, over \u201cthe changes we\u2019re facing.\u201d which I guess means the eighth-graders\u2019 switch from the middle school to the high school building. I don\u2019t understand Dawn sometimes. She\u2019s still my best friend but hello? I mean, we\u2019re thirteen. We belong with the older kids. Especially the guys. Okay, we don\u2019t \u201crule.\u201d Okay, high school kids lured us to that party at Ms. Krueger\u2019s empty house, just to get us in trouble. But only some of them did. Most of the others seem pretty cool. Like Ducky. Anyway, consider the alternative. Who wants to hang with teddy bear huggers and giggle over squeaky-voiced boys?\n\nMaybe Jill does. Honestly, that girl really makes me sick. I\u2019m glad Maggie and Dawn and I have drifted away from her.\n\nIf any of my friends\u2014any of them, even Dawn\u2014read this, they\u2019d fall over. They think I\u2019m so confident. So together. (Well, maybe not together. They saw me hurl chunks at the party. Not exactly a together thing to do.)\n\nSometimes I think I\u2019m the only eighth-grader at Vista who tries to have any fun at all. Which is totally ironic, considering my frame of mind. I think the move turned everyone into zombies.\n\nIncluding Maggie, who used to be so cool. That\u2019s ancient history. She refused to cut math with me today. And she was so freaked out when I had my navel pierced. Dawn was too, but I kind of expected that. (Jill, of course, almost fainted, which makes it so fun to flash my ring at her in the school hallways.)\n\nI don\u2019t know why I even bother trying to show signs of life. Nobody appreciates it. Everybody is mad at me for something. It\u2019s not just Dawn and Maggie, either. Dad\u2019s being a pain too. He keeps telling me I should be more serious. And all my teachers think I\u2019m a slacker.\n\nI know. I should start wearing plaid wool skirts, stop painting my fingernails black, join the math club, and discuss global politics at lunch. I mean, life is hard enough. PEOPLE SHOULD LIGHTEN UP, in my humble opinion.\n\nI just yawned. That\u2019s a good sign.\n\nI am boring myself to sleep.\n\nJust as well. My fingers are starting to hurt. I have never written this much in my life.",

She\u2019s allowed to be mad at the world. I would be, if I had lung cancer. (Actually, I am mad, at the tobacco companies.)\n\nShe\u2019s also depressed about going to the hospital. For two days she has not worn her wig. She says she\u2019s too tired to put it on. She wears a kerchief instead, to cover her thinning hair. She says it will all grow back when the chemotherapy ends. I can\u2019t wait. Not that the hair matters. I mean, I\u2019d take Mom bald and bearded if she were healthy again. It\u2019s just that not wearing a wig seems like some kind of signal. As if Mom is starting to give up.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m thinking about it too much. Maybe she is just tired. Besides, wearing that wig must be like having a thick old hat on all day. Would I do it?

The final counts double, of course, so a 100 on that would make it 788/8 = 98.5.\n\nIf I could average in what I really got on that first test\u2014105 with the bonus points\u2014I\u2019d already be at 98.6. Ms. Sevekow keeps saying she doesn\u2019t believe in counting bonus points into your average if they gave you over a 100 test score. Fine. So why won\u2019t she let me transfer the points to another test? Like, bring the 94 up to a 99? That is so unfair. But I can\u2019t argue about it. There are enough nerds in the class who would, and I am not one of them.\n\nI\u2019ll just have to do better next time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday\n\n5:17 P.M.\n\n\nWhy are my fingers SO STIFF?\n\nSomething must be wrong with me. Maybe I\u2019m coming down with arthritis.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not me. Maybe it\u2019s Mrs. Knudsen. She assigned me the Beethoven \u201cPath\u00e9tique Sonata\u201d on purpose. She knew I couldn\u2019t possibly play it. She knows my fingers can\u2019t handle so many notes.\n\nShe\u2019s trying to make me quit. That way she won\u2019t have to listen to all my clinkers anymore.\n\nListen to me. I am feeling so sorry for myself. Even Curtis (such a good cat) seems sick of my complaining. I don\u2019t even have to say anything\u2014he just knows.\n\nI just need to practice more. That\u2019s all. Plus I have to insist on pieces that are more fun. Classical\u2019s nice, but once in a while I want to jump forward to this century.\n\nNext week I\u2019ll give Mrs. Knudsen an ultimatum. I\u2019ll agree to learn Beethoven if she agrees to teach me the blues.\n\nOn piano, that is.\n\nA knock on the door. Got to go.\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday\n\n9:46 P.M.\n\n\nThe good news: That knock was Dad.\n\nHe was home early from work. Which is pretty amazing, considering Fatal Judgment opens in three weeks. At this point, he\u2019s usually in the office 24 hours a day.\n\nThe bad news: He had heard every minute of my piano lesson.\n\nAnd that was what he wanted to talk about.\n\n\u201cSo, practicing enough, honey?\u201d he asked.\n\nI said no. I told him how busy I\u2019d been\u2014math test, book report, and so on.\n\nHe nodded. He told me he\u2019d just beaten Carlton Grant in tennis.\n\n\u201cYou always beat him,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I keep up my game,\u201d Dad replied. \u201cNo matter how busy I am, no matter how many meetings I take, nothing stands in the way of my tennis game. Why? Because it\u2019s my passion, Maggie. Always make time for your passion.\u201d\n\nAt first I had no idea what he was talking about. Then I realized.\n\n\u201cYou mean, I should practice piano more,\u201d I said.\n\nDad nodded. \u201cYou do enjoy it, don\u2019t you? I mean, I hope I haven\u2019t been paying Mrs. Knudsen for eight years in vain.\u201d\n\nWhy does he always bring this up?\n\nI reassured him. I said I enjoyed lessons. I promised I\u2019d practice more.\n\nBut he still had this strange, super-concerned look. \u201cThis Dustin fellow? Is he\u2014are you and he\u2014?\u201d\n\nDustin.\n\nDustin Hoffman?\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cSunny just called. I didn\u2019t get you because you were in the middle of your lesson. She mentioned this fellow!!!\u201d\n\nJustin.\n\nDad was asking me if Justin and I were going out.\n\nWhy? Because Sunny had gushed about him. And she\u2019d asked if I had mentioned him yet.\n\nAnd somehow Dad got the idea that I had a crush on him.\n\nI was so humiliated.\n\nHow could she do this?\n\nI explained everything to Dad. I told him about my lunch conversation with Sunny. I explained that I didn\u2019t know Justin.\n\nDad nodded. But he still had that concerned look. \u201cMind if we talk a bit, Maggie? I was sitting in the kitchen, listening to you play, and I thought: Maybe she needs to branch out. Something more than just piano lessons. A school activity. You\u2019d still have plenty of time to practice.\u201d\n\nI reminded him of my extracurriculars. Honor Society. Inner Vistas.\n\n\u201cWhat Vistas?\u201d he asked.\n\nI know I\u2019ve explained Inner Vistas to him. But when I told him it was a literary magazine, and I explained I was poetry editor, he seemed to be hearing it for the first time.\n\nHe barely even acknowledged it. It was as if I\u2019d told him I was on the school wallpaper committee or something. Right away he asked me if I\u2019d be interested in joining Drama Club.\n\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like show business,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cJust checking,\u201d Dad replied. \u201cInterests change. Anyway, you do like music, right? How about the school orchestra?\u201d\n\nI told him that wasn\u2019t a bad idea, but I was happy doing just what I\u2019m doing now.\n\nHis face got really serious. He said I needed to think about college. According to him, \u201cthe top-drawer schools\u201d want more than excellent grades. They want interesting, involved kids with lots of extracurriculars.\n\n\u201cYou have to work up to your best ability,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you\u2019ll be competing shoulder-to-shoulder with other kids who are. And now that you\u2019re in high school, it\u2019s a good time to start.\u201d\n\nI reminded him I was not in high school. Just in the high-school building.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to split hairs,\u201d Dad said. \u201cMost eighth-graders are already putting their five-year plans in order.\u201d\n\nFive-year plan?\n\nI never heard of such a thing. But Dad knows all about it. He had one.\n\nWhen Dad was my age, he was already making films. Which was one of the reasons he got into UCLA. Which put him on the road to future success. He\u2019s told me that a hundred times.\n\nWell, I\u2019m not going into filmmaking, that\u2019s for sure. No matter how much he tries to convince me. Someday I want to say to him, \u201cLook what I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll head up a magazine someday. Or establish my own. Or publish a book of poems. Or be a veterinarian. Who knows?\n\nDad is right about one thing. I\u2019ll need to go to a great college. But for my reasons. To follow my road to success, using my talents.\n\nIf I need extra activities to do that, fine. I\u2019ll join some.\n\nTomorrow I can talk to Mr. Pearson about orchestra.\n\n\n\n\n\nThursday morning, 11/13\n\nToo early\n\n\nChains\n\nPrison Confine\n\nCapture.\n\nChamber Skin Shell\n\nTough. But breakable. Thin/hard\n\nIt\u2019s lonely in here\n\nBut it\u2019s lonely outside\n\nGet me out of this shell\n\nNo, I don\u2019t wanna hide\n\nWanna f",

          "text": "Sun 12/21\n\nDear Nbook,\nI will never EVER leave you out in plain sight again. Not after today.\nIsabel, if you are reading this, you are the witch sister of Christmas Present and I hope you melt into the carpet with Big Tooth Lover Boy standing over you and crying his guts out.\nI have been writing in you since September, Nbook. You and I both know this hasn\u2019t been easy. I hate writing, so I draw a lot. And everything I write is so POLITE.\n\nNo more. It\u2019s time to say what\u2019s on my mind.\n\nI mean, we\u2019re all home today and everybody\u2019s having a good time \u2014 Christmas, happy happy, whatever. I\u2019m in my room, wrapping presents I bought for Mami and Papi. And Isabel barges in without knocking. And where are you, Nbook? Faceup on my bed, where I\u2019ve left you.\n\n\u201cCute,\u201d says Isabel. \u201cYou can write?\u201d\n\nI am boiling inside. But you know me, Nbook. I always keep cool. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly drawings,\u201d I say. \u201cKeep your hands off.\u201d\n\nDoes Isabel listen? No. She never listens. She just has to open you up. To the Christmas picture. She sees the drawing of her and Big Tooth Lover Boy. Only Simon\u2019s teeth don\u2019t show because he\u2019s kissing her in the picture.\n\nNow she wants to kill me.\n\nI ask you, is this fair?\n\nI will never understand my big sister. To me, she\u2019s Dr. Jekyll. (Or is it Mr. Hyde? Anyway, the bad one.) To the rest of the world, she\u2019s saint Isabel of the Lost Causes.\n\nShe gets Christmas cards from her old teachers in San Diego. (Do I? No. My teachers are thrilled that I moved.) She\u2019s constantly bringing home gifts from the women\u2019s shelter where she works. \u201cOne of the residents gave this to me,\u201d she says. \u201cJust a little something for the holiday.\u201d\n\nI want to give Isabel a little something for the holiday. A bonk over the head.\n\nThese journals are supposed to be private.\n\nWhich brings me to another point. No offense, Nbook, but why did we have to move to a place where the schools force you to write journals? We didn\u2019t have to write journals in San Diego.\n\nSome of my classmates have been doing this since first grade. To them it\u2019s, like, ho hum, another five pages.\n\nTo me, it\u2019s torture. Already my fingers are cramping.\n\nThe worst part is, it\u2019s totally pointless, since the teachers are never ever going to collect it.\n\nSo why do I open up my inner thoughts to my nosy sister who everybody loves even though she\u2019s a thief who steals my private property?\n\nI know why.\n\nBecause, Nbook, you are very cool.\n\nBut from now on, you stay under my mattress.\n\nFa la la la la, la la la la.",

People drop hints. But I\u2019ve never thought much about it one way or another. What\u2019s inside a person is what counts. Inside, Maggie is friendly and talented and unsnobby.\n\nTonight, Nbook, I see the outside for the first time.\n\nI\u2019m at the Blumes\u2019 for dinner. Dawn and Sunny are there too. The house is at the top of this canyon. It\u2019s so high up you look down into the smog. The backyard looks like they imported a small Hawaiian island and plopped it right there. The pool is huge.\n\nWe sit down to eat, and the plates look so expensive I\u2019m afraid to touch them. But it doesn\u2019t matter because the maid takes them away and serves dinner on different plates anyway. Which seems weird to me but I don\u2019t say anything.\n\nThe maid\u2019s name is Pilar and she\u2019s Latina. Maggie says she\u2019s studying to be an actress. I wonder if she\u2019s acting when she smiles at everybody and takes orders from Mr. and Mrs. Blume.\n\nThe main course is this shrimp dish that\u2019s about the most delicious thing I\u2019ve ever eaten. So I do the polite thing and compliment the Blumes on their cooking.\n\nWell, Mrs. Blume gives me this funny, tight-lipped smile. Mr. Blume laughs and says, \u201cIt\u2019s catered.\u201d And I feel like melting into the Persian rug.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, Nbook. Things loosen up eventually, and I end up having a good time.\n\nBut now I have a new problem. My Christmas list. My belated procrastinator\u2019s Christmas list that I shouldn\u2019t even be thinking about anymore.\n\nOver dinner, as I listen carefully to the conversation, I pick up what people want to receive. Which is helpful in some ways, but not in others.\n\nOkay, here\u2019s the whole thing, with my changes added (including people who weren\u2019t at dinner):\n\n\nRevised Christmas Shopping List Saint Isabel (who I overhear telling Big Tooth Lover Boy she\u2019ll \u201cdie\u201d if anyone gives her another sweater) \u2014 Return sweater. Buy earrings. Or maybe a bag of coal.\n\nCece \u2014 Hair stuff.\n\nMarina \u2014 Science fiction book, not related to Star Wars or Star Trek. (Does that leave anything?)\n\nMaggie \u2014 Oh, just something that the daughter of Hayden Blume the gazillionaire movie producer might not have. Like maybe her own private village.\n\nDawn and Sunny \u2014 ????? Gift friends or nongift friends?\n\nJames \u2014 ????? Boyfriend gift (cologne)? Or friend friend gift (new shades)?\n\nTo be decided by tomorrow!",

Like me.\n\nThen you don\u2019t celebrate. You walk around feeling sorry for yourself. You might as well stay home.\n\nBut look on the bright side, McCrae.\n\nTomorrow also happens to be Friday the 13th.\n\nSo maybe having a Valentine is unlucky. And the best thing to do is go to school and don\u2019t worry.\n\nYou will not worry.\n\nYou will not worry.\n\nYou will not worry.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring Homeroom, F the 13\n\n\nTucked into a Looseleaf Notebook\n\nThe place is a zoo, and it\u2019s all my fault.\n\nFlowers everywhere. Teachers acting like kids. Jason tongue-wrestling with Lisa out in the hallway.\n\nJAY, not JASON.\n\nJAY.\n\nJAY.\n\nI hate this. You know somebody for years\u2014he\u2019s spent a whole LIFETIME with one name, and all of a sudden BOOM he decides another one is cooler. So now you have to THINK every time you see him, and then you have to call him a name that doesn\u2019t fit, sort of like calling a telephone a toaster\u2014BUT god forbid you don\u2019t, because he\u2019ll get mad at you, and of course it would NEVER OCCUR to him or anyone else to wonder if you mind being called \u201cDucky,\u201d a name you didn\u2019t CHOOSE, because you\u2019ve always been known by it and besides, it\u2019s better than the name the Cro Mags used to call you, \u201cBambi\u201d\u2014and hey, CRO MAG is a nickname YOU throw around, but that\u2019s just a DESCRIPTION, because those muscle-head jocks DO act like prehistoric Cro-Magnon cavepeople\u2014plus, when you think about it, \u201cDucky\u201d fits anyway because it\u2019s weird and funny and so are you.\n\nAnyway, congrats, McCrae. You did V day RIGHT this year.\n\nYou did not:\n\n\u2026Stay home and hide, like you wanted to.\n\n\u2026Let big brother Ted talk you into a blind date, like the one two years ago with Shelaigh, who wore more makeup than clothing and whose greatest talent was rolling her eyes, tapping her feet, and looking at her watch in three different rhythms.\n\n\u2026Write every single girl in your class a poetic love note, like you did in seventh grade, causing many of them to gang up against you on the playground and three parents to call Mom & Dad complaining you\u2019d broken their daughters\u2019 hearts.\n\n\u2026Make Mom a Valentine\u2019s Day card with so much glue that it stuck to the kitchen table and she got mad at you so you flushed the chocolates you were going to give her down the toilet and clogged it up, ruining the whole day for everyone\u2026that was fourth grade, I think.\n\nNope, Ducky old boy, you\u2019ve learned the hard way. You don\u2019t need a Special Someone. Today you were EVERYONE ELSE\u2019s Special Someone.\n\nWith style.\n\nThe fake halo made of twist-ties, the bow and arrow slung over your back, the big basket of carnations\u2014brilliant. All that was missing was a marquee out front\u2014\u201cChristopher \u2018Ducky\u2019 McCrae IS cupid!\u201d\n\nThe girls LOVED it. Especially Sunny, who planted a big wet one on your lips, then actually threaded the stem of the carnation through her navel ring and flashed it around, until Mr. Dean came out of the office. Dawn put HER flower in her long blonde hair and spun around, doing some folk-dancey thing that made her peasant dress spin out. Maggie kissed hers and said she would write a song about it.\n\nGiving flowers to the TEACHERS\u2014that was the best idea of all. From the look on Ms. Patterson\u2019s face, expect an A in math this semester.\n\nOkay, so not EVERYONE was amused. Mr. Dean couldn\u2019t decide whether to throw you out or laugh. And Alex sort of looked right through you (that thousand-yard stare of Alex Snyder). And the Cro Mags, of course, had a field day, grunting and scratching and passing nasty comments to each other. You have to take the good with the bad.\n\nBut here\u2019s another big change. A year ago, McCrae, the Cro Mag comments would have killed you. A year ago, you worried about their opinions. You wanted them to be your friends. HOW many years did it take to realize THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE FUN OF YOU NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRIED TO BE LIKE THEM?\n\nAs if you ever could.\n\nSo\u2026if you can\u2019t join them, do exactly what they hate. Like dance past them, singing \u201call you need is love,\u201d and toss them a flower\u2014then watch the look on Marco Bardwell\u2019s face the moment after he catches it and realizes his apelike friends are NEVER going to let him live it down.\n\nDucky, you may be strange but you are a genius.\n\nIf only JAY hadn\u2019t gotten so bent out of shape. JAY, being one of your oldest friends, should KNOW your sense of humor, but obviously he doesn\u2019t, because he acted like you handed him a dead squid and muttered, \u201cDo you ALWAYS have to make a fool of yourself?\u201d\n\nDo you?\n\nDo I?\n\nEven Later That Afternoon\n\nIn Math Class, to Be Exact\n\nI.\n\nI.\n\nI.\n\nWhy do I call myself \u201cyou\u201d all the time? This can\u2019t be normal. Only I don\u2019t know, because to figure out what \u201cnormal\u201d is, I\u2019d have to read other people\u2019s journals and I\u2019m not allowed because Vista requires you to keep yours PRIVATE, to \u201cprovide you with a personal learning experience,\u201d but it WOULD be nice if you could at least see A LITTLE of someone else\u2019s, because soon the world will be full of Vista students with piles of unread journals and that seems like such a waste of both paper and interesting stories.\n\nWhat it boils down to is this: writing \u201cI\u201d is creepy. TOO personal. You feel self-conscious. You worry about how you come across. But with \u201cyou,\u201d it\u2019s like you\u2019re another person. It\u2019s just easier, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s easier to be someone else.\n\nHere comes Ms. Patterson. If she sees this, I\u2019m toast.\n\n2B cont.\n\nHome at Last\n\nStill Depressed\n\nBut Not Toast\n\nI wish I hadn\u2019t written that.\n\nThe part about being someone else.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about it all day.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of pathetic, in a way. Like you can\u2019t stand being yourself.\n\nI asked Sunny about this. I asked her if she ever wanted to be someone else.\n\nShe said she always wants to be someone else.\n\nWhich is RIDICULOUS because she\u2019s great exactly the way she is (I told her so), but she just said that if I were in her shoes\u2014if MY mom had cancer, if MY dad spent a",

She said she must be losing her mind. She thought it was already tonight.\n\nI had to calm her down. I told her the phone did not wake anyone but me\u2014which is a lie, because I hear someone walking around in the kitchen. I also said she couldn\u2019t be losing her mind. If she were, she wouldn\u2019t have remembered I was staying at Dawn\u2019s house.\n\nThat didn\u2019t convince her.\n\nDoesn\u2019t convince me either.\n\nMom is slipping.\n\nI mean, the hair loss and weight loss were bad enough. But we expected that.\n\nNot the mind, though. Lung cancer isn\u2019t supposed to affect the brain.\n\nI don\u2019t understand this. All the hospital visits, all the chemo and radiation\u2014they\u2019re all supposed to help. But they\u2019re not. She\u2019s just getting worse and worse. Plus she\u2019s exhausted from all the trips to the hospital.\n\nFace it. Winslow.\n\nRead between the lines.\n\nDr. Merwin has stopped talking about \u201cgood signs.\u201d\n\nThere are no good signs.\n\nShe\u2019s not going to get better.\n\nSo what\u2019s the point? Dad should just take her away from that horrible place, bring her back home where she\u2019ll be comfortable. Take care of her.\n\nIn sickness and in health. Isn\u2019t that what they say at weddings?\n\nDad wouldn\u2019t remember. He only remembers sales figures. Everything\u2019s the store, the store, the store. What\u2019s he going to do when the store is all he has?\n\nTill death do us part. That\u2019s the other thing they say.\n\nThe truth is, Mom would be better off dying at home.\n\nThere.\n\nI said it.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not sorry.\n\nWhy do I do this to myself?\n\nI am staying at Dawn\u2019s to escape. I\u2019m not supposed to get all worked up.\n\nWhy do I bother writing in this thing? This doesn\u2019t help my insomnia!\n\nI am crazy, that\u2019s why. I not only have a miserable, depressing life, but I write about it. Just to make myself feel worse.\n\nAnd what\u2019s Dawn doing? Snoring. Dreaming about happy Dawn stuff, probably. A perfect world, with lots of flowers but no allergies. Animals roaming freely on the streets. People giving up their cars, riding bikes to work, picking berries and vegetables for lunch. Peace on earth. Whatever.\n\nI love her.\n\nI really do.\n\nDawn, if you find this and are peeking at this page, that paragraph was a joke. I love you!\n\nShe is my best friend. She lets me stay at her house. If I couldn\u2019t do that, if I had to be home every day, I\u2019d be a nutcase.\n\nI have to be kind to her.\n\nEven if she snores.\n\nI have nudged her a few times. That shuts her up for, oh, 30 seconds. Then she starts up, louder than ever.\n\nI can\u2019t stay in this room.\n\nI know what I have to do.\n\nEat.\n\n4:32\n\nBad bad bad idea.\n\nI think I have permanently lost my appetite.\n\nCarol was puttering around in the kitchen. Well, maybe not puttering. With that big old pregnant belly, it was more like lumbering.\n\nI was relived. Any other grown-up would have yelled at me for being up so late. But Carol was \u2026 Carol. 32 going on 15. \u201cInsomnia too?\u201d she said. \u201cCool, let\u2019s have a midnight snack.\u201d\n\nWhich sounded great. I mean, if I had to have company while I was awake, it might as well be someone I like.\n\nSo Carol began chatting away about her pregnancy and her crazy appetite, and about how she had to \u201ceat for two\u201d now.\n\nI politely went along. I took a plastic container of leftover Chinese food out of the fridge. I put it on the table, ready to inhale it.\n\nAnd then I saw what Carol was eating.\n\nTuna fish.\n\nAnd chocolate.\n\nTogether.\n\nShe was standing there, blabbering away, with strands of stringy brown glop stuck between her teeth.\n\nBack into the fridge went the Chinese food. And here I am again. In bed, listening to Dawn\u2019s snores.\n\nAt least I\u2019m not hungry.\n\nNow I can\u2019t eat or sleep.\n\nOh, well. I\u2019ll just stay awake. I\u2019ll fill up this journal. I\u2019ll fill 2 journals. Ms. Newell will be so impressed. Maybe I\u2019ll even pass English.\n\nI can publish it. The Incredible Revolting Life of Sunshine Daydream Winslow, A Memoir.\n\nOh. I forgot. We have to keep these journals private. No one is ever supposed to see them. That\u2019s part of the vista school experience.\n\nSo what happens if you show them to someone? You flunk?\n\nI think Chris has the right idea.

          "text": "Saturday morning 6/6\n\nJournals are for talking about your feelings. Here\u2019s what I am feeling:\n\nLonely.\n\nTense.\n\nSad.\n\nI look at what I\u2019ve just written and I am amazed. None of it sounds like me. I used to be an upbeat kind of person. I tried not to show my negative feelings to the rest of the world. But I can\u2019t deny that I feel them. This is me, Dawn Schafer, right now.\n\nLonely.\n\nTense.\n\nSad.\n\nI know why I\u2019m upset. Sunny, my very best friend in the whole world, has turned into an entirely different person.\n\nMake that my former best friend.\n\nThe only other time I have felt this terrible was when Mom and Dad were first divorced. And I had to leave California to live on the other side of the country with Mom. I hated leaving Sunny. And I missed her the whole time I lived on the East Coast.\n\nSunny was one of the main reasons I moved back to California. When her mother was diagnosed with lung cancer I thought Sunny would need her best friend close by. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m here for Mrs. Winslow, but I was totally wrong about what Sunny needed.\n\nIt\u2019s so ironic. I moved back to be close to Sunny and we aren\u2019t even speaking to each other.\n\nMaybe Sunny and I were only best friends because we were neighbors. No, that doesn\u2019t make sense. We used to do absolutely everything together. We could finish each other\u2019s sentences. The phone would ring, and I would know it was Sunny before I picked up the receiver. I could walk into her house anytime and feel like a member of the family. Sunny could do that at our house too. Even after Dad remarried and Carol moved in with us. Another irony\u2014Sunny gets along better with Carol than I do.\n\nI hate that Sunny isn\u2019t acting like Sunny anymore. She\u2019s changed from this clever, considerate, always-there-for-you friend into a sneaky, inconsiderate, never-to-be-trusted-again stranger. Sunny is the last person I would have expected to change like that. Especially now, when her family is going through such a hard time. I mean, we have to face it\u2014Mrs. Winslow is \u2026 Well, they don\u2019t have much hope anymore that she will ever get better. Just writing that made me cry. Mrs. Winslow is wonderful, like a second mother to me. I\u2019m a lot closer to her than I\u2019ll ever be to Carol.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is why Sunny is turning into some other person just when her mother and father need her the most. It\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t care about anyone but herself. She skips school, hangs out with older guys, is dressing in a different way that\u2019s very \u2026 adult. It\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t care what people think about her. But what bothers me the most is that Sunny is not there for her mother.\n\nInstead of visiting her mother in the hospital, she\u2019s been over at our place an awful lot, taking care of Carol because she\u2019s having a baby. I do feel sorry for Carol. The doctor ordered her to stay in bed for the last three months of her pregnancy. She can\u2019t even get up to go to the bathroom. We have to bring her a bedpan. I know it\u2019s hard on Carol, but it\u2019s also a lot of extra work for Dad and me. Even Jeff is pitching in. But we didn\u2019t expect Sunny to help out. Especially not when it meant neglecting her own sick mother. If my mother were sick I would be with her as much as possible. But I want to think about that possibility. It\u2019s too awful.\n\nAn ambulance just drove up our street and pulled into the Winslows\u2019 driveway. Mrs. Winslow has been getting sicker every day. So she\u2019s either going back to the hospital or \u2026 I want to run over there to find out what\u2019s going on. I want to help. But how can I when Sunny and I aren\u2019t even talking? I\u2019m so worried about Mrs. Winslow.\n\nCarol just rang the little bell she uses to say she needs something. Later \u2026",

          "text": "Saturday morning continued 6/6\n\nMrs. Winslow has gone back to the hospital. Carol and I saw them take her out on a stretcher. Mr. Winslow was walking beside his wife. He didn\u2019t go in the ambulance but followed it in his car. He looked really sad. He had been so happy that his wife was home again. We all were. We hoped she\u2019d be able to stay this time.\n\nAt first I thought Sunny wasn\u2019t home and that\u2019s why she wasn\u2019t with her mother. But then I spotted her peeking out from behind the blinds in the living room. I told Carol that if it were my mother I\u2019d be in the ambulance with her. Carol said that might not be what Mrs. Winslow wanted.\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d I asked. \u201cSunny is her daughter.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe she\u2019s going later.\u201d Carol patted her big belly. \u201cI can\u2019t help remembering that my baby and I were almost taken away in an ambulance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks to Sunny,\u201d I pointed out.\n\n\u201cAccidents happen,\u201d said Carol.\n\nShe has been standing up for Sunny a lot lately. What almost happened to Carol and the baby wasn\u2019t an accident. It was Sunny\u2019s fault. Plain and simple.\n\nI know it was almost two months ago, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. Sunny promised she\u2019d watch out for Carol, who was not supposed to get out of bed under any circumstances. Sunny promised Mrs. Bruen that she\u2019d keep an eye on the pot of stew that was cooking on the stove. And what did Sunny do when a cute guy came driving up our block, blowing his horn? She ran out of the house, leaving the stew on the stove and Carol helpless in bed.\n\nSo what happened? My former best friend, Sunshine Winslow, almost burned our house down and put the lives of two people in grave danger.\n\nAnd what did Sunny do about it?\n\nDid she apologize?\n\nDid she act like she cared?\n\nNo. She ran away. And when she finally came back, she had an attitude and made all sorts of excuses for herself. She just hung around waiting for everyone to say it was okay. Well, it wasn\u2019t okay. It wasn\u2019t okay. We don\u2019t need someone like that around here.\n\nI can\u2019t stop thinking about the fight Sunny and I had that night. I play it over and over in my head like a movie.\n\nMrs. Bruen told me what happened and that Sunny had run out.",

          "text": "Someone brought a dozen donuts into the office kitchen this morning. I was nauseous just looking at them. Grease, fat, calories! Croissants are just as bad. They\u2019re full of butter.\n\nThis afternoon I have to make 35 copies of the script for the next film Dad\u2019s producing. They finally settled on a title for it\u2014Never.\n\nDuring my first week of work Dad asked me to read the script for Never. \u201cWrite up a summary of the plot and tell me what you think of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI value your opinion.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t really care what I think about the script. He just wants me to feel like I\u2019m part of his team.\n\nI read it.\n\nI think Never is a perfect name for this movie. As in, \u201cNever go see it.\u201d But I didn\u2019t write that in my \u201creview.\u201d I told Dad what I knew he wanted to hear\u2014\u201cExciting and suspenseful.\u201d It would just have caused tension between us if I told him what I really think.\n\nIt\u2019s so weird. Hundreds of people are working and spending zillions of dollars on a movie that is basically dumb. Car chases and violence. All that money wasted.\n\nI know Dad isn\u2019t always proud of the kinds of films he makes. But he is proud of being a big success.\n\nHis movies make money.\n\nHe likes his money and all the things it can buy.\n\nIncluding all the things that keep the Blume family going.\n\nSometimes I feel like a hypocrite when I think about Dad like this. I live in the big fancy house. Swim in the pool. Wear the nice clothes (though they don\u2019t look so nice on me). And have all kinds of advantages.\n\nBut working for my father is NOT one of them. At work he is Mr. Phony. Mr. Schmooze. Mr. I\u2019ll-kill-you-with-kindness-but-you-have-to-do-it-my-way.\n\nWe see that side of Dad at home sometimes. But at Blume Productions it\u2019s one hundred percent.\n\nDad secretly wishes he were a writer/director instead of a producer. That\u2019s probably why he suggested I use my free time in the office to try scriptwriting. I said I didn\u2019t have any ideas for a script. He said, \u201cWrite what you know. Look around. Listen in on conversations. Then write a little scene. I wish I\u2019d done that when I was your age. It\u2019s a big advantage to start young. You\u2019re lucky.\u201d\n\nDad thinks he\u2019s doing me this big favor by giving me a job in his office when I\u2019m only thirteen. He promised me that I\u2019d be able to work in the music end of his new film. I was excited about working for Flanders Delmont. He\u2019s a composer whose work I really admire. Dad said I would be in Flanders\u2019 studio at least half the time. I\u2019d meet other people in the music business. I\u2019d see how Flanders composed and ran his business.\n\nIt sounded great until Flanders Delmont decided to run his business out of his home office in Australia.\n\nSo here I am, stuck in Schmoozeville with Dad and his new assistant, Duane Richards. Duane is quickly learning the fine art of schmoozing. Today it was, \u201cMaggie, you look so-o-o very glamorous today.\u201d\n\nWhat a liar.\n\nI look terrible today. Fat, dull, and so-o-o very boring.\n\nDARKNESS\n\nSunlight Summer sun too bright for\n\nthe sad day within\n\nWhy do troubles haunt\n\nand taunt?\n\nWhy do my inner darks cloud out obscure the light?\n\nAre the answers in the darkness?\n\n\u00a9 Maggie Blume\n\nThat is the first poem I\u2019ve written in weeks. It used to make me feel better to express my feelings in poetry. But I don\u2019t feel any better for writing that poem. Maybe I should try scriptwriting.\n\nNEVER\u2026 TELL THE TRUTH\n\n(Inspired by a conversation overheard between Producer and a scriptwriter)\n\nA large office in Hollywood. Producer sits behind a big desk. Writer sits in a small chair facing him.\n\nPRODUCER: We need another chase scene, Ralph. And put a school bus in the car chase scene. Our main character\u2019s kid should be on that bus.\n\nWRITER: But Mr. Blume, our main character doesn\u2019t have a kid.\n\nPRODUCER: Then we\u2019ll give him one. I know you, Ralph. You can work it in. You\u2019ve done a great job. Let the bus be central in the chase. It can go off one of those cliffs in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nWRITER: Do you want the kid injured or killed?\n\nPRODUCER: Both.\n\nWRITER: Both?\n\nPRODUCER: We think he\u2019s dead, but he\u2019s only injured\u2014seriously injured. We don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll make it. Put in a hospital scene. (He gets up, a signal that it\u2019s time for the writer to leave.) Why don\u2019t you come by the house for a drink, say around seven? There\u2019ll be some people there I\u2019d love you to meet.\n\nWRITER: (smiling) Great. Love to.\n\nDad is already looking for a new writer to rewrite the Never script. Everyone on the project knows it. But that night, when the writer came to the house, Dad and his business partners in the film acted like he was the hottest writer in Hollywood. I hate all that phoniness. Hate it.\n\nDad is back from one of his wheeler\u2011dealer lunches. I better hit the photocopy machine.\n\n4:05 P.M.\n\nAmalia called. There\u2019s a Vanish rehearsal tonight. The band hasn\u2019t practiced much this summer. We all have summer jobs with different work schedules. Talking to Amalia made me wish we had more time to hang out together.

Bulimics who wrecked their digestive systems from throwing up too much.\n\nI read about \u201cbinge-eating disorder\u201d (out-of-control eating), \u201canorexia athletica\u201d (starving yourself because you\u2019re preoccupied with exercise), \u201cnight-eating syndrome\u201d (starving during the day but binge\u2011eating at night), \u201cnocturnal sleep\u2011related disorder\u201d (starving during the day but eating in a half\u2011asleep, half\u2011awake state).\n\nSuddenly I feel very full.\n\nThe article\u2019s pretty hopeful, though.

Then I\u2019d stay out of trouble.\n\nToday, for instance.\n\nMaggie and I hang out at the Vista Hills Mall. After reading that article, I\u2019m looking at her differently than I used to. Noticing things. Like (1) She\u2019s constantly gazing at herself in mirrors and sucking in her stomach (such as it is). (2) She changes the subject when I suggest a snack in the food court. (3) She\u2019s being really weird about clothes.\n\nWe\u2019re browsing in Carswell-Hayes. I find this retro \u201970s skirt\u2014very cool, very Maggie\u2014so I hold it up. She feels the material and makes a face. Then she says, \u201cToo clingy\u201d and turns away.\n\nI\u2019m not expecting this reaction. I mean, clingy dresses are made for figures like Maggie\u2019s. And size 4 is plenty big for her, anyway.\n\nThis is what I mean, Nbook. She thinks she\u2019s too fat. I\u2019m thinking, Is this bizarre or what?\n\nBut it\u2019s not bizarre at all. It\u2019s typical behavior of an anorexic. I know that from the article.\n\nSo. Time to talk, right?\n\nRight.\n\nBut I don\u2019t want to be obvious. I figure I\u2019ll lead into it gently. In a roundabout way.\n\nI talk about clothes. I talk about movies. TV. CDs. Homework.\n\nWe have a lovely conversation. About nothing. Then we go home.\n\nAnd now I feel like a total chicken.\n\nMe.

He detours onto back roads through treacherous Windsor Hills and Inglewood, finally reaching the airport\u2014and yes, ladies and gentlemen, he makes it to Gate 21 TWO MINUTES early! 5:35 for a 5:37 arriving flight.\n\nDucky the MIRACLE WORKER. Ducky the GOOD SON. HERE for his parents when they arrive from Ghana\u2014on a SCHOOL NIGHT, the day before a math test.\n\nWhy? Because he WANTS TO. Because that\u2019s the kind of guy he is.\n\nThen he checks the arrival screen. And he sees:\n\nFLIGHT 407 1 HOUR LATE\n\n(Cue laugh track.)\n\nWhat a fool.\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s analyze this, Ducky.\n\nYou might have known. This HAS happened before. Mom and Dad\u2019s overseas flights are almost ALWAYS late.\n\nYou could have called in advance to check. If you knew, you wouldn\u2019t have panicked and rushed.\n\nNow, suddenly, you have time to kill and nothing to do. And this would be a PERFECT opportunity for some badly needed math review. But you can\u2019t do it because\u2014in your hurry\u2014you forgot your review material.\n\nAnd why are you here alone to pick up your lucky parents on the day before a math test?\n\nWell, that breaks down into two questions:\n\n1. Why are YOU here? Because Ted, Older and More Beloved Son, couldn\u2019t be. You see, Ducky, he\u2019s a COLLEGE boy. You may have homework, but he has a COURSE LOAD.\n\n2. Why are you here ALONE? Because none of your friends would come along to keep you company.\n\nNot Jay, formerly known as Jason, once your best friend and now a member of the Vista School Cro Mags, dedicated to the grunt-and-snort school of social behavior. Jay\u2019s helpful comment? \u201cCome on, Duckster, they\u2019re old enough to get home by themselves.\u201d Which, you have to admit, isn\u2019t a bad point.\n\nNot Alex. Too depressed, of course. (Which doesn\u2019t surprise you. But because you\u2019re best friends, and because you\u2019ve been HELPING him through the gloomy state he\u2019s in, you still hoped he might come along. No such luck.)\n\nNot Sunny, even though she\u2019s ALWAYS looking for excuses to get away from her house. She\u2019s busy tonight\u2014with what or whom she won\u2019t say, but you know her slippery\u2011cute tone of voice translates into: NEW BOYFRIEND. Which means you may not see her for awhile\u2026until, of course, this guy turns out to be just like the others, and she comes back to cry on your shoulder. And that\u2019s FINE because Sunny needs you, she\u2019s freaking out because of her mom\u2019s cancer, and the boyfriends are a way of escaping reality.\n\nYou understand everyone\u2019s excuses, because that\u2019s what you do best, Ducky. You think of others first.\n\nAnd second. And third.\n\nSomewhere down the list of concerns\u2014oh, maybe near the price of asparagus and the political situation in Norway\u2014is YOU.\n\nI.\n\nSay I when you mean I, Ducky. Don\u2019t hide.\n\nWhen am I going to learn?\n\nMaybe Jay is right. You COULD have let Mom and Dad take a car service.\n\nYou I should think about yourself myself for a change.\n\nMYSELF. ME.\n\nGod, I hate the way that sounds.",

Boy, do you remember THAT feeling.\n\nThe two little boys at Gate 22 running into a crowd of arriving passengers and being scooped up by a tired but happy businessman. The mom joins them, making a four\u2011person sandwich, and you can almost hear them squeal, \u201cWe\u2019re the ham and cheese, you\u2019re the bread!\u201d\u2014but no, that\u2019s what YOU used to say. It\u2019s only a memory. But you can taste the hope and excitement in the air. You know what those boys are thinking now. Today Daddy\u2019s home for good. Today everything will be normal again.\n\nMaybe for them it\u2019s true. Maybe THEIR parents aren\u2019t professors\u2011slash\u2011international business consultants like yours.\n\nFor YOU, Ducky, things were never normal. Because Mom and Dad always had another trip. And when they were gone, you worried they\u2019d forget you, or find new kids to love, or just plain never come back. You counted the days on a calendar and looked at atlases and encyclopedias, hoping to see Paris through Mom\u2019s and Dad\u2019s eyes, or Boston or Abu Dhabi or Toronto or Sri Lanka. And you wondered why you couldn\u2019t have gone along too and WHAT you did wrong and HOW you could make them want to stay home next time\u2014IF I CLEAN MY ROOM EVERY DAY, IF I STOP YELLING AT MY BROTHER, IF I GET STRAIGHT A\u2019S\u2026\n\nThe trips eventually became a part of life, expected, unavoidable, like breakfast and homework. The fears became hidden away like a scabbed\u2011over wound\u2014and soon even the scab was gone, leaving only a scar.\n\nScars protect. Scars heal. But they\u2019re markers too, reminders of what\u2019s underneath.\n\nSo when you see that toddler and those boys, the scar stretches. You feel a little of the old pain.\n\nAnd you ask some of the old questions: What will Mom and Dad be like when they arrive? Will they be happy to see you? How long will they stay this time? Until the spring? Until the new year, at least?\n\nThe difference between now and then is that at 16, you KNOW some of the answers.\n\nYou know to settle for reality. Which isn\u2019t too bad, really. Soon 121 Sherwood Road will look and smell the way it used to. Like a house with a real family in it.\n\nStill, you want something MORE.\n\nAn edge. An electricity.\n\nSomething.\n\nAnd you know you won\u2019t get it.",

This is such a draggy time of year. Even in California. We don\u2019t get all that snow and ice and slush we used to have in Connecticut, but we\u2019ve had endless storms and rains and\n\nOops. Sorry. Gracie was crying. Now I\u2019m back. I\u2019m baby-sitting tonight. These are my big Friday night plans. Baby-sitting for Gracie and Jeff.\n\nThis has been the great excitement of the week: On Tuesday the groundhog saw his shadow, so we will have six more weeks of winter. Big deal.\n\nI can never understand how that groundhog thing works. Year after year it mystifies me. What is that ground-hog\u2019s name? Punxatonnie Slim? (I think he resides in Pennsylvania.) And why does seeing his shadow mean a longer winter? If he sees his shadow, doesn\u2019t that mean it\u2019s a nice sunny day? And would that mean that we\u2019re already enjoying an early spring? Very strange.\n\nOh, well. I don\u2019t think Punxatonnie Slim\u2019s condition in Pennsylvania has all that much to do with California weather anyway.\n\nBoy. Gracie is really fussy tonight. Maybe she\u2019s getting new teeth. I\u2019ve decided to keep her up with me for awhile. Now she\u2019s on her tummy on my floor, examining the bunnies on her blanket. She seems a lot happier, but I MUST get her back in her crib before Dad and Carol come home. They won\u2019t appreciate my laid-back baby-sitting techniques. They\u2014Yikes there\u2019s their car",

She must have to go to great lengths to appear so busy that, day after day, she can\u2019t get to the hospital.\n\nI think I\u2019ll visit Mrs. Winslow today.\n\nThis afternoon.",

          "text": "Later Saturday afternoon 2/6\n\nOh. My. God.\n\nMrs. Winslow looks dreadful. Absolutely dreadful. Her hair was just starting to grow back and then they began chemo on her again, and now it\u2019s coming out in brushfuls. I brought her a new scarf today so we could experiment with styling. She tied it on her head so that just a few wispy bangs were showing.\n\n\u201cHow should I fix these, Dawn?\u201d she said. She was looking at her bangs in a hand mirror and holding up a comb.\n\n\u201cMaybe sort of over to the side,\u201d I suggested.\n\nSo she ran the comb through the bangs and pulled them out. I mean, all the bangs. Clean out of her head.\n\nI nearly cried.\n\nBut Mrs. Winslow just held up a big pair of gold hoop earrings and said, \u201cWell, if I want the pirate look, it\u2019ll work better without the bangs.\u201d And then she dropped her bangs into the wastebasket (on top of another clump of hair).\n\nI forced a laugh. \u201cThe pirate look. Oh, that\u2019s your best look.\u201d\n\nMrs. Winslow set the comb and mirror aside. She put on the earrings. \u201cHow\u2019s Gracie?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cTeething,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cOh, poor you. Poor all of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeff got up in the middle of the night and slept on the kitchen floor,\u201d I told her. \u201cHe tried the bathroom first, but the kitchen was farther away from Gracie\u2019s room. Anything to escape the screeching. I slept with my headphones on.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmart girl,\u201d said Mrs. Winslow.\n\nI really wanted to ask if Sunny had been by recently, but I didn\u2019t say anything. I didn\u2019t want to put Mrs. Winslow in the middle. She knows Sunny and I aren\u2019t speaking (much), and she feels bad about it. She also feels hurt that Sunny visits her so rarely. But she doesn\u2019t mention it. At least not to me. After all, Sunny is her daughter.\n\nI tried to make myself useful. I watered Mrs. Winslow\u2019s flowers. I tidied a pile of newspapers and magazines and set them under the visitor\u2019s chair. Mrs. Winslow is lucky to have a private room, but god it\u2019s tiny. You can barely walk around her bed. The rest of the furniture consists of a narrow table that slides across the bed so she can eat (which she hardly ever feels like doing), the visitor\u2019s chair (just one), a TV, which is bolted high up in a corner of the room and is really hard to operate, and the wastebasket. That\u2019s it. I tidied up in, like, 45 seconds. After that I filled the water glass and got Mrs. Winslow another blanket. (She\u2019s cold all the time.) By then I was starting to get nervous that Sunny might show up after all, and I really didn\u2019t want to run into her.\n\nI put my jacket on. \u201cSo how long do you think you\u2019ll be here this time?\u201d I asked.\n\nMrs. Winslow shrugged. \u201cI never know. Awhile, I guess.\u201d\n\nI nodded. Then I kissed her cheek, said good-bye, and left.\n\nYou know what? This is completely ridiculous, but every time I kiss Mrs. Winslow this teeny, tiny part of me wonders if you can catch cancer. I know you can\u2019t.\n\nAnd still I wonder.",

          "text": "5:32 A.M.\n\nI wonder if I\u2019ll ever be able to sleep late again. My inner clock is all messed up. I could fall asleep in the middle of the day, and I could be wide\u2011awake at 4:00 A.M. I never need to set an alarm clock anymore. No matter what time I set it for I always wake up before it goes off.\n\nI can\u2019t stop thinking about Mom. All day, all night. Is this what\u2019s called an obsession?\n\n\n6:03 A.M.\n\nAfter I wrote that, I tried to go back to sleep. Put the diary away, turned off my light, crawled under the covers.\n\nNo good.\n\nNada.\n\nFirst all these thoughts just kept blowing through my brain. Then I could hear Mom downstairs calling to Dad. It was like some messed\u2011up, blurry, not\u2011quite\u2011right scene from my childhood. I thought back to nights when I was little and sick with the flu or a cold or something. I couldn\u2019t sleep and I\u2019d call out and in a flash Mom would be there for me. Now I lie in my bed and listen to Mom call out. Everything is wrong with this scene. Mom is in bed downstairs, not upstairs in her own room, the room she should be sharing with Dad. And she, the adult, is the one calling out, while Dad is the one rushing to comfort her.\n\nGod, I can\u2019t stand it.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll go to school today.\n\n\n6:24 A.M.\n\nI can\u2019t decide. Should I go to school today? I don\u2019t want to be there, of all places, if Mom should\n\nLet me start over. I mean, if Mom\n\nThis is too hard.\n\n\n6:45 A.M.\n\nOkay, I\u2019m going to go to school. I\u2019m driving myself crazy here.\n\nWe\u2019re keeping a vigil.\n\nA vigil. Who keeps watch these days? That sounds archaic. But that\u2019s what I overheard Dad say on the phone last night. He was talking (whispering, really) to someone from the bookstore. He said that yes, Mom had come home from the hospital a few days ago and we\u2019re keeping a vigil. Sometimes, especially lately, Dad seems overly dramatic to me, so I take the vigil reference with a grain of salt.\n\nGod.\n\nI\u2019m being driven crazy.\n\nEven this journal is driving me crazy. Sometimes it feels like my only true friend. At the same time I feel as though I\u2019m chained to it (emotionally).\n\nAll right. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m going to go to school today. Dad will call me if anything changes.",

The ones who know me well are thinking, \u201cThere she is. Poor Sunny.\u201d The ones who don\u2019t know me well are thinking, \u201cIs that her? Is she the one whose mother is dying?\u201d\n\nMom is dying kind of dramatically. Maybe that\u2019s why Dad seems so dramatic these days. This is like nothing you ever hear about in real life. I thought people only died this way in the movies. Like Beth in Little Women. Just made\u2011up people. I thought when real people died you sat around in the hospital waiting room until finally the doctor came out and said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s over.\u201d And then everyone cried and started to make funeral arrangements.\n\nMy head is swimming.\n\nTired. No sleep.\n\nVery mad.\n\n\n10:32 A.M.\n\nStill haven\u2019t been to class. Not even sure what period this is.\n\nFirst I sat in the library. Then it started to fill up. Moved to an empty classroom.

Mr. Hackett said, \u201cHow\u2019s it going, Sunny?\u201d like he was asking about a social studies project, and I said, \u201cFine.\u201d",

Some kid in my kindergarten class was turning six. I didn\u2019t want to go. I knew we were going to play pin\u2011the\u2011tail\u2011on\u2011the\u2011donkey, and I hated that game. I hated being blindfolded and spun around. It was embarrassing and humiliating, everyone watching you dumbly look for the donkey, the stupid cardboard tail clutched in your hand. And for what? So you could win a set of markers or a plastic charm bracelet? I told Mom I didn\u2019t want to go to the party and she made me go anyway.\n\nI told her I hated her.\n\n\n11:11 A.M.\n\nYou know, this is kind of nice. I\u2019m still sitting by the door. Just me and my notebook. That\u2019s it. No books, no Walkman. Don\u2019t even have my purse. I stuck some change in my pants pocket this morning, grabbed the journal, and left.\n\n\n11:13 A.M.\n\nI didn\u2019t say good\u2011bye to Mom.\n\n\n11:25 A.M.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m Alice, down the rabbit hole. Everyone here is living in a different world. I think I\u2019m a visitor from some other place. The people here \u2014 they walk around so easily. They don\u2019t know how awful life can be.

I was expecting that she would drag me to a table with Maggie and Amalia. But she led me to an empty table and we sat alone. I wasn\u2019t going to eat anything, but Dawn handed me something.

Ducky\u2019s parents are hardly ever home and his best friend tried to kill himself.\n\n3) My mother is a bigger problem for me than I like to admit. I hate that she\u2019s so out of control with her drinking. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m the mother. (This is when I cried. I seem to cry about something in almost every session.)\n\n4) Don\u2019t worry about Justin, since we both seem to be moving on to other people.\n\n5) Relax.

It seemed like EVERYONE was staring at me. I overheard a woman at the catering table tell the woman next to her, \u201cThat\u2019s her. The one in the newspaper.\u201d\n\nSince I didn\u2019t see Tyler on the set, I headed for his trailer. He opened the door right away when I knocked.\n\nI was glad he was alone, which meant we were alone.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked me.\n\nI told him how people stared at me when I walked through the set. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you stand it,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cSorry. I still feel terrible about the other night.\u201d\n\nI was just about to say that it wasn\u2019t his fault when the door to the trailer was flung open and Felicia walked in.\n\n\u201cAh, the lovebirds,\u201d she teased.\n\n\u201cCut it out, Felicia,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI told you we were just\u2014\u201d He stopped himself midsentence, then asked, \u201cWait\u2014did you tip off the press?\u201d\n\nShe grinned.\n\n\u201cNot cool,\u201d Tyler said. I could tell he was really angry. \u201cI\u2019d never do that to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublicity is good, Ty,\u201d she said as she flung an arm around his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad.\u201d\n\nTyler\u2019s uncle arrived then. A young woman wearing a headset and walkie-talkie was right behind him.\n\n\u201cWe need Tyler and Felicia on the set,\u201d the woman announced.\n\n\u201cHow are you today, Ms. Blume?\u201d Uncle Fred asked.\n\nI mumbled, \u201cFine,\u201d and left the trailer with everyone else.\n\nThey\u2019re filming on a new set now\u2014a caf\u00e9/surfer shop called Catch the Wave. In the new scene, Vivian enters the caf\u00e9, nervously looks around for J.B., sees him, and shyly says hello. Then she has a line about surfing. He says some-thing about school. They\u2019re each trying to make the other more relaxed. But they don\u2019t seem relaxed. Probably because neither of the actors are. They\u2019ve filmed this scene six times so far.\n\nI haven\u2019t had a chance to be alone with Tyler again. He came over to talk to me between takes. So did Felicia. I bet she was making sure we didn\u2019t have any more private moments. I think (I hope?) Tyler was as frustrated by that as I was.\n\nFelicia is acting like she\u2019s jealous of me, which is way too weird to even contemplate. It\u2019s probably all an act, in case a gossip columnist shows up on the set.\n\nHere comes the assistant director, Maura Davis.\n\nMore later.",

I know it\u2019s not true and I\u2019ve washed it ten times BUT THAT\u2019S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. Right at that spot on the left cheek where she spit at me.\n\nWhy?\n\nWHY?\n\nWhat did I do, Nbook? WHAT DID I DO?\n\nGot to think straight. My head is splitting apart.\n\nOK, slow down.\n\nStart at the beginning.\n\nIt hurts to think about the beginning\u2014because it was so wonderful, Nbook. We walk into Cafe\u00b4 Con Leche, and Andre\u00b4 makes me feel like his favorite customer. Romantic booth. Free appetizers. Treats Brendan like a son. Doggie bag full of pastries, on the house.\n\nAt the cineplex, the usher knows we have food but doesn\u2019t stop us. The movie\u2019s much better than I expect it to be. And Brendan is so nice. He puts his arm around my shoulder\u2014the right way too. Doesn\u2019t keep it there for two hours like a cement drainpipe, the way Danny Cruz did in San Diego. And he doesn\u2019t wait for me to laugh before he laughs (which Danny also did).\n\nAnyway, I feel us kind of melting together. Like a couple, Nbook. Like I finally, really want us to be a couple\u2014because I trust him.\n\nToward the end of the movie he leans over toward me\u2014gently, easily\u2014and I can tell he wants to kiss me, but it doesn\u2019t feel awkward or pressured, and I know that if I just keep looking at the screen he\u2019ll turn away and it\u2019ll be OK, he\u2019ll understand. But I don\u2019t want to turn away\u2014he\u2019s so tender and handsome, and our kiss lasts just the right amount of time\u2014and when it\u2019s over I feel thrilled. Afterward, he doesn\u2019t act all weird, like now our faces should be welded together at the lips for the rest of the movie. We sit back, arms around each other, relaxed and happy.\n\nWe leave the cineplex, arm in arm. Isabel\u2019s not there yet, but that\u2019s OK because the night is clear and cool. I know nothing bad is going to happen. I\u2019m safe with him. He\u2019s no James.\n\nPeople are flowing out of the theater, splitting off in various directions, until we\u2019re the only ones left standing in front. Soon the usher starts to lock the door, but Brendan runs to her and convinces her to let him use the rest room.\n\nAs he goes inside, the usher asks if I want to wait in the lobby. I say no thanks. I want to smell the blossoms, not stale popcorn.\n\nSo I stay outside, breathing the sweet air, looking up the street for Isabel\u2019s car. I figure she\u2019s probably having a great time too, which means she\u2019ll be late and maybe Brendan and I can hang out at the ice-cream shop.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if the shop is open. It looks like its lights are off. So I\u2019m squinting, trying to see it clearer, when I hear voices behind me\u2014girls\u2019 voices. None of them sound familiar, so I don\u2019t bother looking back. Half of them are laughing, drowning out the words of the others.\n\nLike someone has just reached into me and ripped out my soul. The usher is talking to me, asking questions, but I don\u2019t hear her. I am not thinking in words. I am seeing red and black. I want to run after those girls and pull out their hair, throw them against the brick wall, make them feel how I feel.\n\nBut they\u2019re far away now, weaving down the street\u2014fast. They\u2019re laughing and slapping each other five. They\u2019re not even looking back over their shoulders. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t exist. I was a game. A distraction.\n\nTo them, I am not even a person.\n\nAnd then suddenly I see\n\nAll I can think is What took you so long? Where were you? But I don\u2019t say it.\n\nHe and the woman help me up. I try to tell them what happened, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m bad enough with words to begin with. Now they\u2019re all slipping and sliding out of my mouth with no sense.\n\nThe worst part is the spit. I mean, I\u2019m not normally grossed out by blood or body fluids. But when I felt that spit on my cheek I almost threw up.\n\nIt\u2019s not the saliva. It\u2019s what it means. Spit is a waste product. It belongs in a toilet or a sink\u2014or the gutter or a sewer. Not on a human being\u2019s face.\n\nIt feels like it\u2019s still there, Nbook.\n\nLike I\u2019ll never get it off.",

I\u2019m dreaming I\u2019m in Dr. Fuentes\u2019s office but my hair is dyed blonde and I\u2019m slapping thick base on my face. Very light base. The girls from last night are looking at me through a two-way mirror and laughing like crazy. I can hear them and so can Dr. F but I put on the makeup anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s a dream, it\u2019s not real, I remind myself.\n\nI wish all of last night were a dream, Nbook. I could forget about it then. But it\u2019s stuck in my brain, and I can\u2019t stop thinking of those faces, those leering faces looking at me like I\u2019m some thing, like an old shoe or a dead pigeon.\n\nI don\u2019t look at anyone like that. Do I? No one\u2019s supposed to treat another person that way.\n\nWhat did I do? What did I say?\n\nWHY DO I KEEP ASKING THAT?\n\nI didn\u2019t do anything. I was there, that\u2019s all.\n\nI was Latina. I am Latina.\n\nI mean, yeah, OK, this stuff happens. I know that, Nbook. I\u2019m not stupid. My eyes and ears are open. I read papers and magazines and I watch the news. The reminders are all around, every week. The way Papi is treated sometimes by the people at his company. The way that patient of Mami\u2019s sneered and said, \u201cVargas? I thought that was Italian,\u201d and never came for a second session. And all the other small, daily stuff at Vista like the girls who talk one way with white girls and a whole other way with me. The jokes that suddenly get cut off when someone sees me.\n\nIt\u2019s bad. It\u2019s wrong. But you live with it. What else can you do? You tell people when it bothers you. You love your family and friends, you do your best, and you realize the world ain\u2019t perfect and never will be. That\u2019s all any of us can do.\n\nI know that.\n\nBut they spat on me, Nbook.\n\nThey knocked me down and spat on me and walked away.\n\nAnd they were proud of it.\n\nThen what? What do they do when they get home? Brag to their moms and dads? \u201cWell, let\u2019s see, w",

These include a horror book set at the beach, Moby\u2011Dick, several guides to shells, a book about beach vacations, and Treasure Island (personal childhood favorite). You\u2019ve decided to insist it be included, even if Sunny objects.\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t. Instead, she suggests that you get some petty cash and buy a bottle of suntan lotion and some not\u2011too\u2011uncool\u2011but\u2011cheap sunglasses to go with the display.\n\nYou return to find Sunny arranging the books on a couple of beach towels that she has also brought along.\n\nYou remind her that she\u2019ll be in trouble if she gets sand in the books' bindings.\n\nOr at least if they were library books she would be.\n\nShe makes a face.

Cleaning wasn\u2019t all we\u2019d done, though.\n\nFirst, we\u2019d made breakfast \u2014 or rather, my mom made breakfast, and I ate it. She cooked my favorite: blueberry pancakes. I love them because they\u2019re naturally sweet, so I don\u2019t miss the oceans of maple syrup that most people drown their pancakes in.",

In case you don\u2019t know what that means, let me explain. First of all, it\u2019s a disease I\u2019ll have for the rest of my life, so I\u2019ve had to learn to live with it. My pancreas (that\u2019s one of those weird\u2011shaped organs inside you) doesn\u2019t do its job right. It doesn\u2019t make this stuff called insulin, which people need to help them digest carbohydrates and sugar.\n\nSince my body can\u2019t handle sugar too well, I have to be very, very careful about what I eat and when I eat it. Also, I have to supply the insulin that my pancreas can\u2019t. How do I do that? Well, I give myself shots every day. I know, ew\u2011ew\u2011ew, right? But it\u2019s not so bad once you get used to it.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t have a choice, anyway. If I don\u2019t take care of myself, I can get really sick. In fact, not too long ago, I found that out for sure. I slipped a little on my diet and stopped taking care of myself the way I should, and guess what. I landed in the hospital. I don\u2019t want that to happen again any time soon, so I\u2019m back to being Little Miss Healthy of Stoneybrook, Connecticut.",

I used to be a real New Yorker \u2014 I loved shopping at Bloomingdale\u2019s, going to the Hard Rock Cafe, seeing musical on Broadway. But you know what? Now I love Stoneybrook, too.\n\nMy family first moved from New York to Stoneybrook a while back, when my dad got transferred by his company. We adjusted pretty well to the move \u2014 in fact, I was really, really happy in Stoneybrook. Not too long after we\u2019d moved there, I became a member of this great club \u2014 a baby\u2011sitting club. I\u2019d always loved to baby\u2011sit, and joining the club was like getting a whole bunch of best friends all at once.\n\nBut the club\u2019s another story. I\u2019ll tell you more about that later. I\u2019m just trying to explain why I was so happy in Stoneybrook \u2014 so that you\u2019ll understand what a shock it was when my dad got transferred back to the city and we had to leave!",

She would sweep the floor, and I would mop it. We were working well together.\n\nMom had turned the radio to an oldies station, and we were having a blast singing along to these songs that had been popular when she was a teenager. Over the years she\u2019s taught me the words to a lot of them, so now I can \u201cdo the twist\u201d and \u201cshake it up, baby\u201d with the best of them.\n\nI\u2019d just been dancing with the mop to \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand,\u201d when the song ended and Roy Orbison came on singing \u201cOh, Pretty Woman.\u201d My mom wandered into the kitchen with a faraway look in her eyes. \u201cI love that song,\u201d she said. \u201cIt always reminds me of my sixteenth birthday.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine your mother as a sixteen\u2011year\u2011old.\n\n\u201cDid you have a sweet\u2011sixteen party?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAre you kidding? I had the biggest, best sweet\u2011sixteen party of the decade. Didn\u2019t I ever show you the pictures?\u201d She dragged me into the living room and sat me on the couch. Then she pulled an old, beat\u2011up photo album off the shelf.\n\n\u201cOh, right,\u201d I said, as soon as I saw the pictures. \u201cNow I remember. That\u2019s where you were wearing that funny dress, and you had that weird hairdo \u2014 what\u2019s it called? A wasps\u2019 nest?\u201d\n\n\u201cA beehive,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think my dress was so funny. It was my first real grown\u2011up dress, and I had high heels to match. I felt like a million dollars that day.\u201d\n\nWe looked at the pictures together. \u201cYou do look happy,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI always loved to celebrate my birthday,\u201d Mom told me. \u201cAnd that one was the most fun of all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love my birthday, too.\u201d I said. Then I remembered something I\u2019d been meaning to bring up. \u201cIn fact,\u201d I added in a rush, deciding that now was as good a time as any, \u201csince my birthday has always had such a special meaning for me, I was wondering if you might like to help me buy this ring I saw at the Stoneybrook Jeweler\u2019s.\u201d There. I\u2019d said it.\n\n\u201cRing?\u201d asked my mother. \u201cWhat does this have to do with your birthday? Your birthday is months away.\u201d She closed the photo album and looked at me.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t mean that the ring would b",

          "text": "First of all, I\u2019d better tell you who I am. My name is Dawn Schafer, and I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I\u2019m thirteen and I\u2019m in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School.\n\nI haven\u2019t always lived in Connecticut. Guess where I grew up? In California! That\u2019s right, sunny California. My life there sometimes seems like ancient history, though. I\u2019m pretty used to living in Connecticut now. That\u2019s right, snowy Connecticut, home of the BSC. (That\u2019s shorthand for the Baby\u2011sitters Club.)\n\nThe club really saved my life when I first moved here. I was pretty lonely then, and still upset about my parents\u2019 divorce. That\u2019s why we moved here, by the way \u2014 because my parents got a divorce. My dad stayed in California, but my mom and I and my younger brother Jeff (he\u2019s ten) moved to Stoneybrook, where my mom had grown up.\n\nMom felt comfortable here right away, since Connecticut was so familiar to her. But it took me a lot longer to get used to living in a new place. And Jeff? Jeff never really adjusted. In fact, he disliked Connecticut so much (and missed his dad so badly on top of it) that he ended up moving back to California to live with him. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m happy about our family being split up, but I\u2019m glad we did what was best for Jeff.\n\nSo you probably think that it\u2019s just me and my mom living together in the big old (and I mean old) farmhouse we bought. But you\u2019re wrong. Something pretty exciting happened after we moved back here. Mom got together with an old high\u2011school sweetheart of hers who still lived in Stoneybrook, and after they\u2019d dated for what seemed like years, they got married! The best part is that I gained not only a stepfather (Richard Spier is his name), but a stepsister as well. And my stepsister was \u2014 and is \u2014 my best friend!\n\nTalk about lucky.\n\nOf course, I didn\u2019t feel all that lucky right away. Mary Anne and I hit some rough spots before we ironed out our new relationship as stepsisters and housemates. But now a pretty happy family is living in that farmhouse: Richard and Mom, Mary Anne and me, and Tigger, Mary Anne\u2019s gray kitten.",

          "text": "Luckily for me, James and Mathew Hobart, the two middle brothers (James is eight and Mathew\u2019s six) were playing in the yard with some of the neighborhood kids. They didn\u2019t need me to entertain them. And Ben, the oldest Hobart boy? Where was he? Well, red\u2011haired Ben, who\u2019s a sixth\u2011grader like my friend, fellow club\u2011member Mallory Pike, was at the library, studying. And he wasn\u2019t alone. He was with \u2014 guess who \u2014 Mallory herself. I think something romantic may be going on between them. Isn\u2019t that exciting?\n\nJohnny had found the shoe and had started to look for the next picture, which was of a birthday cake. I glanced at the kids playing in the side yard. James and Mathew seemed to be having a good time kicking a soccer ball around. I knew two of the kids they were playing with pretty well: Nicky Pike, who is Mallory\u2019s little brother, and Jamie Newton, who is a boy I\u2019ve baby\u2011sat for fairly often. The other two, Zach Wolfson and Mel Tucker, were less familiar to me, but I knew them from the neighborhood. Zach and Mel aren\u2019t what I would call bad kids, but they have been known to enjoy teasing kids who are \u201cdifferent.\u201d Kristy once had a hard time trying to teach them not to make fun of this autistic girl, Susan.\n\nThe boys were in a circle, passing a soccer ball back and forth in some complicated pattern that I didn\u2019t quite understand. Just as I looked up to check on James and Mathew, James gave a mighty kick at the ball \u2014 and missed. It rolled behind him, out of the circle.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, you dumb Croc?\u201d yelled Mel.\n\nOh no. Not that again. I waited to see what James would do.\n\n\u201cI asked you not to call me that, remember?\u201d said James to Mel. He sounded calm.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d said Mel. \u201cSorry. Now get the ball!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Zach. \u201cAnd hurry up, Cr \u2014 I mean, James!\u201d\n\nI shook my head. I had thought that the kids were all getting along pretty well, but it seemed that Mel and Zach hadn\u2019t lost the habit of bullying James \u2014 and probably Mathew, too.\n\nSee, the Hobarts are Australian. That\u2019s why Mel calls them \u201cCrocs.\u201d You know, for Crocodile Dundee? But the Hobart boys (understandably) hate being teased about their accents, their habits, or the strange (to us) words they sometimes use. They just want to fit in and be accepted. And for the most part, they are. Mel and Zach are the only ones who still tease them, as far as I can see.\n\nI wonder why kids are sometimes so mean to each other. Maybe it has more to d",

Mouse\u2011aroni sounded like a fast food for cats. Claire can be so silly sometimes. I guess all five\u2011year\u2011olds have their silly moments, but my little sister really takes the cake. I admit that there are times when I find her silliness irritating, but that night I was in a great mood, so I just went along with it.\n\n\u201cOkay, Miss Mouse\u2011aroni,\u201d I said. \u201cBring that cheese over here and let me start grating it.\u201d We were making English muffin pizzas for dinner as a surprise for my mom. She\u2019d phoned to say she\u2019d be coming home late that night, because of a PTA meeting that was running overtime. I knew she\u2019d be thrilled to find dinner on the table when she got in.\n\nI was also steaming some artichokes, my favorite vegetable. They are so much fun to eat. You pull off one leaf at a time, dip it in melted butter or salad dressing, and scrape off the edible part with your teeth. I know, it sounds weird, but once you\u2019ve tried them, you\u2019ll love them, too. We don\u2019t have artichokes too often \u2014 they\u2019re kind of expensive \u2014 but once in a while Mom will buy them for a treat.\n\n\u201cOkay, Claire,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s time to get out the English muffins. Can you bring them over here?\u201d Claire loves to \u201chelp\u201d in the kitchen, and even though her way of helping sometimes makes everything twice as complicated, I like to let her cook with me whenever I can. She gets such a kick out of it.\n\nBy the time Claire found the English muffins and danced them over to me, I\u2019d finished grating the cheese. The tomato sauce (from a jar \u2014 I didn\u2019t have time to make it from scratch) was simmering. It was time to start the assembly line. English muffin pizzas are easy to make. All you do is open up each muffin and arrange the halves on a cookie sheet. Then you put a little tomato sauce on each one. Then you put some grated mozzarella (or meetsabeenie, if you prefer) on each one. Then you shake a little oregano on the tops, and into the broiler they go! Easy. And yummy.\n\nBut making them for my family is a bit of a challenge. Why? Because there are ten \u2014 yes, ten \u2014 people in my family. Claire is not my only little sister. I have two others. And I also have four younger brothers. So when I make English muffin pizzas for the whole family, I have to make four cookie sheets\u2019 worth. And sometimes even that\u2019s not enough. English muffin pizzas are one of the few foods that everybody in the family agrees upon. All the Pikes love them.",

I\u2019ve been taking care of my brothers and sisters for so long that sometimes I feel like a mother.\n\nNicky looked about as guilty as an eight\u2011year\u2011old boy can. \u201cNothing,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cJust playing mudball.\u201d\n\n\u201cMudball?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a new one on me. Who thought up that idea?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d said Jordan, coming up behind me. \u201cOr at least, I had the basic idea. Adam and Byron figured out a lot of the details.\u201d He sounded proud of himself. He looked disgusting. He was even muddier than Nicky. By the way, Jordan, Adam, and Byron are all ten. They\u2019re triplets!\n\n\u201cWhat smells so good?\u201d Jordan continued, pretending not to notice my frown.\n\n\u201cEnglish muffin pizzas,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYea!\u201d he shouted.\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re only for people.\u201d I went on. \u201cNot for pigs.\u201d\n\nJordan rolled his eyes. \u201cAll right, all right,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll go clean up. Come on, Nicky.\u201d He grabbed Nicky's arm.\n\n\u201cHold on!\u201d I said. \u201cYou better get those clothes off before you go upstairs. Mom\u2019ll be mad if you guys track mud all over the house.\u201d My mom\u2019s not a fanatic about housecleaning \u2014 nobody with eight kids can afford to be \u2014 but I knew she\u2019d be tired when she got home. And she wouldn\u2019t appreciate her home looking like a dirt\u2011bike track.\n\nJordan and Nicky headed for the laundry room, and I directed Adam and Byron that way, too, when they came in.",

She didn\u2019t seem to notice the way they were dressed. In fact, she didn\u2019t seem to notice that she\u2019d passed them. Vanessa wants to be a poet, and sometimes she gets very caught up in her own little world. She\u2019s dreamy, absentminded, and often totally unaware of whatever might be going on in the real world.

It\u2019s not exactly the Mets, but we have fun. Kristy\u2019s Krushers (that\u2019s the name of my team) is made up mostly of kids who are too young \u2014 or too scared \u2014 to try out for Little League. There are girls and boys on the team, and they range in age from two and a half (can you believe it?) to eight.\n\nI love coaching, maybe because I love being around kids. I\u2019ve known most of the kids on my team for quite a while \u2014 and not just as their coach. I\u2019ve also spent a lot of time baby-sitting for many of them. I love baby\u2011sit almost as much as I love to play, or watch, or coach sports. I even started a club for baby\u2011sitters \u2014 but more about that later.\n\nMaybe I should introduce myself. You\u2019ve probably already figured out my name, right? It\u2019s Kristy. Kristy Thomas. I\u2019m thirteen years old and I\u2019m in the eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School.

Mrs. Kuhn has a job now, though \u2014 and part of the reason she\u2019s working is because she and Mr. Kuhn have separated.

I also have a little brother named David Michael. He\u2019s seven, and he barely remembers our father because he was only a baby when Dad left.\n\nFor a long time, that was my family. Mom, Charlie, Sam, David Michael, and me. Then Mom met this guy named Watson Brewer, and she married him. I wasn\u2019t crazy about him at first, even though he is a millionaire, but now I really like him. Watson had also been married once before, and he has two children, Karen (she\u2019s seven) and Andrew (he\u2019s four). They\u2019re both Krushers, too. They live with us every other weekend and for two weeks in the summer. The rest of the time they live with their mother and stepfather.\n\nAren\u2019t families complicated these days?\n\nAnd I\u2019ve\u2019t even told you quite how complicated my family really is! See, after Mom married Watson and we moved into his house (which I hated at first because it was all the way across town from our old house and old neighborhood), the two of them decided to adopt a baby together. And that\u2019s how Emily Michelle came to live with us. She\u2019s two and a half, she was born in Vietnam, and she\u2019s about the cutest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. She\u2019s also a handful, which is why Nannie, my grandmother, came to live with us, too. Besides the humans in our family, we\u2019ve also got a dog, a cat, and two goldfish.\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering how we all fit into one house. Well, there\u2019s plenty of room, because Watson\u2019s house is actually a mansion. Really! I wasn\u2019t kidding when I said he was a millionaire.\n\nAnyway, we live together happily most of the time. Of course, we fight occasionally, like every family, but underneath it all, we love each other. I\u2019m lucky to have such a neat family.",

Although they are trying to work out custody of the kids (Mrs. Kuhn has custody for now, but Mr. Kuhn wants to get joint custody), they aren\u2019t bad\u2011mouthing each other, and they haven\u2019t turned into nasty, hateful people. They are still friendly to each other, and they both care a lot about the kids.\n\nHow do I know all this? Well, some of it is stuff Mrs. Kuhn told me, and some of it I know from hearing other adults in the neighborhood talk (everybody likes the Kuhns, and they miss Mr. Kuhn now that he\u2019s moved to Texas), and some of it I can just tell by being with the kids. They seem as happy and as well\u2011adjusted as ever.\n\nThere are rough spots, though.\n\nFor example, Jake had been pretty unhappy when I first arrived at the Kuhns\u2019 that day. \u201cM",

I\u2019m basically just your average, typical thirteen-year-old eighth-grader. I\u2019ve lived all my life in a town called Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I have lots of good friends (including a steady boyfriend), a kitten named Tigger (he\u2019s gray, not black and white like the one in the dream), and a stepsister (who also happens to be one of my best friends) named Dawn Schafer.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t have is a mother. I haven\u2019t had one since I was a baby. In fact, I really have no memories of my mother at all. I don\u2019t remember her being sick, and I don\u2019t remember her dying. So I guess I can\u2019t say I miss her, since I didn\u2019t really know her. But I sure do miss having a mother.\n\nMy father has tried to make up for my not having a mother. He truly has done his best. But a father is not the same as a mother, no matter how hard he tries. My father used to be extremely strict with me, but over time he\u2019s begun to loosen up. I think I had to help him learn how to be a father to a teenage girl. There was a lot he didn\u2019t know, until recently. For example, my father didn\u2019t know that a seventh-grade girl should not be forced to wear her hair in pigtails and dress in childish jumpers. My father didn\u2019t know that a seventh-grade girl is quite old enough to decorate her own room. I won\u2019t even get into all the other things my father didn\u2019t know about teenage girls, but I\u2019m sure you can imagine.\n\nI have always been very shy. I think this is because I grew up as an only child and got used to spending a lot of time alone. But in the past year or so, I have learned that being shy does not have to mean being timid. I have learned to stand up to my father and to challenge some of the rules he had made \u2014 just the ones that were obviously ridiculous, that is.\n\nAnd I think my father learned to respect me as a person in my own right, instead of thinking of me as a helpless child. He learned that I am a responsible young adult who does not need someone hovering over her at all times. Plus, I think that learning these lessons allowed him to feel free to get on with his own life. Which is how I got my stepsister!",

She has long blonde hair and blue eyes. She has this laid-back attitude, mellow, but individualistic. And she loves health food like (ugh!) tofu burgers and (ew!) soy milkshakes.\n\nAnyway, as I said, Dawn moved to Stoneybrook from California, along with her mother and her younger brother, Jeff. They\u2019d left California because Dawn\u2019s mom had just gotten a divorce from her dad. And they\u2019d come to Stoneybrook because that was where Mrs. Schafer had grown up. So for Dawn\u2019s mom, it was like coming home to a place where she felt comfortable. For Dawn, it wasn\u2019t so easy. Connecticut is obviously pretty different from California. Dawn hated our cold winters, for example. But she adjusted quickly, partly because she\u2019d joined our club and almost automatically gained a bunch of very good friends.

And here\u2019s the Great Romance, Part Two: After we \u201creintroduced\u201d them, Dawn\u2019s mom (who I now call Sharon) and my dad (who Dawn now calls Richard) fell in love all over again. In fact, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, they got married.\n\nAnd are we now living happily ever after? Well, basically, the answer is yes. My dad and Tigger and I moved in with Dawn and her mom, and it took a while for us all to get used to each other. The house is a really, really old farmhouse (it even has a secret passage that may be \u2014 oooh! \u2014 haunted). At first Dawn and I tried to share a room, but we soon discovered that we each needed our own space.\n\nBut we do get along pretty well, considering how different we are. My dad and I are both neat freaks (at least, that\u2019s what Dawn calls us). Did you ever hear the expression \u201ca place for everything, and everything in its place\u201d? Well, that\u2019s how my dad and I had always lived. We were organized, and tidy, and shipshape. Then we moved in with Sharon and Dawn.\n\nSharon is a wonderful person, and I love her very much, but she is most definitely not what I\u2019d call a neat freak. In fact, she\u2019s kind of the opposite. I\u2019ll give you so",

          "text": "Oh, Lamont, you shouldn\u2019t have!\\\" squealed Becca. \\\"These flowers are so gorgeous. But I don\u2019t know where I can possibly fit them! My entire house is already full of the beautiful flowers you\u2019ve brought me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, actually,\\\" said Charlotte, putting on a deep voice, \\\"these aren\u2019t for you. They\u2019re for Charlotte, and they\u2019re from Derek!\\\"\\n\\nCharlotte and Becca broke into hysterical giggles. Charlotte stuck the bouquet of flowers (actually a crumpled sheet of newspaper) behind a chair and turned to me. \\\"Isn\u2019t it awesome? Derek Masters is coming back to town!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It\u2019s great,\\\" I agreed, hiding a smile. And to tell the truth, it was kind of exciting. Not every little town has a real live TV star. I could understand why the girls were so wild about the news.\\n\\nThe girls were Charlotte Johanssen and Becca Ramsey. I was baby\u2011sitting for Charlotte, and Becca, who is Charlotte\u2019s best friend, was visiting. Who am I? I\u2019m Claudia Kishi. I\u2019m thirteen years old and I\u2019m in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. Stoneybrook, Connecticut, that is. That\u2019s the name of the town I live in. And the town Derek Masters would soon be returning to!\\n\\nDerek Masters, in case you\u2019re wondering, is an actual, genuine TV star. He\u2019s on this really popular show called P.S. 162, about a class in an inner\u2011city elementary school. The character he plays is called Waldo, and he (the character, not Derek) is kind of a geek. But he\u2019s a funny geek, and the other kids in the class like him. He\u2019s not the most popular kid, though. That would be Lamont, who\u2019s smart, and funny, and really cute. Lamont is the one Becca has a giant crush on.\\n\\nAnyway, Derek Masters lived in Stoneybrook long ago before he even dreamed of becoming a star. He used to do a little modeling and stuff like that, and then he was discovered and hit the big time. So now he lives out in L.A. most of the time, since that\u2019s where his work is. But whenever he has a chunk of time off, he and his family come back to Stoneybrook, where they still have a house.\\n\\n\\\"How long is Derek staying this time?\\\" I asked Charlotte. She seemed to have all the inside information on Derek and his plans.\\n\\n\\\"Well, his show\u2019s on hiatus,\\\" she said knowingly. \\\"So I guess he\u2019ll be here for a couple of months.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"His show is on what?\\\" I said.\\n\\n\\\"On hiatus. It\u2019s just a break,\\\" said Becca. \\\"Like, they\u2019ve already made all the shows for this season, so now they have some time off until they start again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How do you know so much about this stuff?\\\" I asked. I was amazed at how sophisticated they sounded, for eight\u2011year\u2011olds.\\n\\n\\\"Derek told Nicky all about it,\\\" said Charlotte. \\\"And Nicky told us.\\\"\\n\\nNicky is Nicky Pike, who is Derek's best friend in Stoneybrook. \\\"So, did Nicky tell you when Derek will be here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Today!\\\" cried Charlotte. \\\"He\u2019s coming today!\\\"\\n\\nBut we probably won\u2019t see him for a few days,\\n\\n\\\"He might not start school until Monday.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don\u2019t know if I can stand it,\\\" said Charlotte, dramatically. \\\"It\u2019s only Wednesday. How can I wait five whole days to see him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, you\u2019ve already waited for about five months,\\\" pointed out Becca. \\\"I think you\u2019ll make it.\\\" She sounded very mature. Then she started to giggle. \\\"But I don\u2019t know if I will! I can\u2019t wait to see him. Maybe this time he got Lamont\u2019s autograph for me!\\\"\\n\\nThe girls started to talk excitedly about what they would wear to school on Monday, and what they would say to Derek when they saw him. I listened for a bit, and then I tuned out. Poor Derek. When he\u2019s in Stoneybrook, what he wants most of all is to be treated like a regular kid, not like a star. He likes to do all the things other eight\u2011year\u2011old boys do. He\u2019s a good big brother to his little brother, Todd. And, while he sometimes has trouble readjusting to \u201cnormal\u201d life, he\u2019s basically just a smart, friendly guy. I hoped the other kids would give him room to be himself, instead of treating him like someone famous. I can understand why he hates that.",

          "text": "I understand a lot about kids. I kind of pride myself on that. It\u2019s not necessarily because I have a natural talent for it, though \u2014 it\u2019s just because I\u2019m around kids a lot. I baby\u2011sit all the time, and it\u2019s something I love to do. In fact, I\u2019m in this club \u2014 the Baby\u2011Sitters Club or BSC. It\u2019s a group of girls \u2014 and one boy \u2014 who love to baby\u2011sit and who have gotten together and made kind of a business of it. I\u2019ll explain more about the club later.\\n\\nUnderstanding kids may not be one of my natural talents, but I do have some of those. Mainly what I\u2019m talented at is art. I love all kinds of art, and without being egotistical about it, I have to say I\u2019m a pretty good artist. Not that I love everything I do. I\u2019ve drawn plenty of pictures only to rip them up, and started and never finished a bunch of sculptures. But I\u2019ve also done some things I\u2019m proud of, and things other people seem to like a lot.\\n\\nI\u2019m always working on some project. Sometimes it\u2019s handmade jewelry, which I love to wear or give as gifts. Sometimes it\u2019s a sculpture or a collage. Other times it\u2019s a series of paintings, like the ones I did of junk food. Yes, junk food. That\u2019s one of my other loves. I could eat Twinkies and Doritos all day long. I think my paintings really showed how much I love the stuff, too, because the objects in the paintings \u2014 a Chunky bar, a pack of Lifesavers \u2014 look beautiful. They\u2019re kind of like portraits. Portraits of loved ones.\\n\\nPretty silly, right? Oh well, maybe you have to see them to understand. Anyway, I do love art. And junk food. What else? Well, I love read mysteries \u2014 especially Nancy Drew stories. My parents don\u2019t approve because they think those books\u2019ll rot my brain. (They don\u2019t approve of junk food, because they think it\u2019ll rot my teeth!) But I keep on reading \u2014 and eating \u2014 what I like. I just keep the books and food hidden, and figure what my parents don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt them.\\n\\nExcept for their lack of taste in food and reading material, my parents are basically",

I don\u2019t have a pet of my own, and I never especially wanted one. I\u2019m a vegetarian, but it\u2019s not because I feel sorry for the cow or anything. It\u2019s just because I don\u2019t really like the taste of red meat. And, while I understand that some people develop very deep relationships with their cats and dogs, I do not understand why they expect me to feel the same way they do about Fluffy or Fido.\n\nTake my stepsister Mary Anne. She\u2019ll hold up her kitten Tigger so that his nose is practically touching mine and say, \"Kiss Tigger, Dawn. Tigger loves you.\" Blechh. I do not believe in kissing cats.\n\nOr take Buddy and Suzi Barrett. They are two kids I baby-sit for sometimes. Buddy\u2019s eight, and Suzi\u2019s five. They\u2019re both really cute: Buddy is kind of skinny, with these big knobby knees, and Suzi is a pudgy girl with pigtails and the most adorable little round tummy. They also have a two-year-old sister named Marnie. Anyway, I was sitting for them on Tuesday, and we were playing with their bassett hound, Pow, and Buddy was actually encouraging Pow to jump up on me, muddy paws and all! I put a stop to that game pretty quickly, believe me.\n\nDo I sound like a nut? I\u2019m not. Really. I\u2019m just a nice, normal thirteen-year-old girl. My name is Dawn Schafer, and I\u2019m in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I have long blonde hair and blue eyes, and I do all the things that nice, normal thirteen-year-old girls do. Except I don\u2019t kiss cats.",

          "text": "I\u2019d been thinking about people and their animals ever since I saw Mrs. Mancusi up by the elementary school. Who is Mrs. Mancusi? She\u2019s a woman who lives not far from me. She and her husband have no children, but they do have about five million pets. Well, maybe I\u2019m exaggerating. But they do have a lot of animals, like at least one of every kind you can think of.\n\nAnyway, on Tuesday I was on my way to the playground with Buddy, Suzi, and Marnie \u2014 and Pow, of course \u2014 and there was Mrs. Mancusi, walking her three dogs. \"Oh, Cheryl,\" I heard her say to the huge Great Dane by her side, \"Isn\u2019t it a beautiful day?\" Then she turned to the little apricot-colored poodle on her other side and said, \"Pooh Bear, do you see the pretty leaves on that tree?\" And then, as if that weren\u2019t enough, she called to Jacques, the golden retriever, \"Jacques, you don\u2019t have to follow behind Pooh Bear! Here, go on and fetch the ball.\" Then she took this gloppy, disgusting ball out of his mouth (he must have been carrying it and slobbering over it all day) and threw it for him.\n\nI just stood there, shaking my head. I mean, why talk to dogs? They can\u2019t talk back, can they? And there\u2019s no way those dogs could have understood a word Mrs. Mancusi said. Well, maybe Jacques understood one word: \"ball.\" But that\u2019s about it.\n\nMrs. Mancusi waved to me. \"Hi, Dawn,\" she called.",

But Pow was with me, and I figured she might want to have a long conversation with him.)\n\nI was in a rush because I didn\u2019t want Suzi and Buddy to be late for softball practice. If they were late, Kristy would be mad at me; she just hates it when people aren\u2019t on time.\n\nWho\u2019s Kristy?\n\nOh, boy, I\u2019d better back up and explain a few things. Remember how I said I baby-sit fairly often for the Barretts? Well, I do. That\u2019s because I love to baby-sit. And it just so happens that I\u2019m good friends with six other girls who love to baby-sit, too. We\u2019re all part of a club: The Baby-sitter\u2019s Club, or the BSC. I\u2019ll tell you more about it later. All you need to know for now is that Kristy Thomas is the president of our club. She runs all our meetings, and that\u2019s how I know about her hating people who are late for things.\n\nBesides being our club president, Kristy also coaches a softball team called Kristy\u2019s Krushers. Cute name, right? The team is pretty cute, too. It consists of about twenty kids, most of whom are too young, or not good enough to play Little League. Some of them are afraid of the ball, some of them can hardly lift a bat, and some of them tend to forget which base is first base. But they all have a good time playing, and Kristy is a great coach. And there are enough decent players on her team so that they even occasionally win a game.",

But Suzi hesitated. \"What about Pow?\" she asked. \"He\u2019ll be lonely without us.\"\n\n\"He\u2019ll be fine,\" I assured her. \"Marnie and I will keep him company.\" I reached down and patted Pow\u2019s head.\n\n\"Well \u2026 okay,\" she said. She gave Pow a quick hug. \" \u2019Bye, Pow,\" she said. \"Wish me luck! If I get a home run, I\u2019ll duplicate it to you.\"\n\nI stifled a giggle. \"I think you mean \u2018dedicate,\u2019 \" I said.\n\n\"Pow knew what I meant,\" said Suzi. She skipped off toward Kristy. When she reached her, she turned and waved. I waved back, even though I wasn\u2019t sure whether she was waving at me or at Pow. Kristy looked over then and saw me. She gave me a big grin and a wave. \"Hi, Dawn,\" she yelled. \"Hi, Marnie!\" Then she turned her attention back to her team.\n\nI watched the Krushers practice for awhile. First Kristy gave them batting practice. She pitched five times to each kid (Kristy is always careful to be very fair), and gave them tips on things like how to keep their swings level or how to step into the ball. Some of the really little kids, like Claire Pike, who\u2019s Suzi\u2019s age, needed special help. \"Claire,\" I heard Kristy say, \"you\u2019ve got to choke up on the bat.\"",

          "text": "\u201cNew York, New York,\u201d I sang, really belting out the words. \u201cThese little-town blues, are melting away,\u201d I went on as I opened my closet. I glanced inside, trying to decide which of my clothes might possibly pass for cool in the big city. After a minute, I shrugged. My clothes don\u2019t even pass for cool in my little town. There was no way any New Yorkers were going to mistake me for a fashion model.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe I was actually going to spend another weekend in the Big Apple. Me, Jessi Ramsey, an eleven-year-old in the sixth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. I was going to be on my own in the most exciting city in the world!\n\nWell, not on my own, exactly. I\u2019d be staying with my friend Stacey McGill, who was going to be visiting her father in his Manhattan apartment. Stacey\u2019s parents are divorced, and she lives with her mother here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, which is the little town I was just referring to. But Stacey\u2019s dad still lives in New York, where Stacey grew up. She visits him fairly often, and this time I was going along.\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t going to be spending all my time with Stacey. The reason I was going was so that I could attend a ballet at Juilliard. What\u2019s Juilliard? Only one of the best music and dance schools in the world, that\u2019s all. And why was I going to a performance there? Well, because this boy I know named Quint Walter was going to be dancing in it, and he\u2019d invited me to come and see him perform.\n\nBallet is my passion in life. I go to a special ballet school in Stamford, which is a city near Stoneybrook. I have been studying ballet for years now, and while I may not be at the Juilliard level, I\u2019d have to say that I\u2019m pretty good. I mean, I don\u2019t want to sound self-centered, but I have worked really hard at my dancing, and the work has paid off. I have actually danced the lead role in several big performances.\n\nStill, ballet isn\u2019t the only thing in my life. I like to do a lot of things, for example: I like to be with my family, which consists of my baby brother, Squirt, my eight\u2011year\u2011old sister, Becca, my parents, and Aunt Cecelia. Oh, and a hamster named Misty. I also love to read, especially horse stories, and I like to spend time with my best friend Mallory Pike, who also loves horse stories. Another of my favorite activities is baby\u2011sitting. I sit for my brother and sister, of course, but I also sit for a lot of kids who live nearby. In fact, I belong to a group called the Baby\u2011sitters Club, and the other members of that club are my good friends. Stacey is a member, and so is Mallory.\n\nI have been to New York before, along with the other members of the BSC (that\u2019s what we call our club). In fact, I met Quint during one of those trips. I had gone to Lincoln Center to see the New York City Ballet dance Swan Lake, and the performance was totally amazing. And then, to top it off, I found myself sitting next to this incredibly cute boy. He turned out to be a dancer, too, and we hit it off right away. In fact, Quint was the first boy I ever kissed! (Not that I kissed him that day. I got to know him a little better, first.)\n\nI was feeling kind of nervous about seeing Quint this time around. We have had what you might call a long\u2011distance romance, and it has been fun, but lately I\u2019ve been wondering if it might be better for us to just be friends. It isn\u2019t easy having a relationship with someone you see only once in awhile. For example, I\u2019m never sure how \u201ctrue\u201d to Quint I\u2019m supposed to be. I have gone to two dances with this seventh\u2011grade boy named Curtis Shaller, who I really like. Does that make me a two\u2011timer? Does Quint also go out with other girls down there in New York? These things have never been clear to me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to talk to him about this,\u201d I said to myself as I poked through my sweater drawer. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019m only eleven, and maybe I shouldn\u2019t really have a steady boyfriend, much less one who lives so far \u2014\u201d",

You mean New\u00a0York,\u201d I said. \u201cNew\u00a0York, New\u00a0York!\u201d I sang out. \u201cThat one?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cWill you teach it to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. Come on, I\u2019ll show you the dance that goes with it, too.\u201d I grabbed her and we faced the mirror. We sang and high\u2011kicked our way through three verses, looking like chorus girls in a Broadway show.\n\nAfterward, we flopped on the bed. \u201cWhew,\u201d I said. \u201cThat was fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Becca. But she didn\u2019t sound too happy.\n\nI glanced over at her. She was chewing on her thumbnail and looking as if she were about to cry. Kids can change their moods so fast!\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I asked her.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, but she was still frowning.\n\n\u201cCome on, Becca, you can tell me,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\nShe sighed. \u201cI\u2019m being abandoned by my own family, that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong,\u201d she replied. A tear began to glisten in the corner of her eye. \u201cYou\u2019re going to New\u00a0York this weekend, and Mom and Dad and Squirt and Aunt Cecelia are all going to that wedding. And I\u2019m going to be left behind, all by myself!\u201d Her lip quivered, and the tear fell. \u201cNobody loves me,\u201d she said, giving a little sniff.\n\n\u201cOh, Becca, of course we love you,\u201d I said, reaching over to give her a hug. \u201cAnd nobody\u2019s abandoning you, or leaving you alone. You\u2019ll be staying with the Pikes.\u201d I smiled at her. \u201cYou\u2019ll have fun there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill not,\u201d she said, sniffing again.\n\nI could understand why Becca was feeling a little left out. It was true that everyone else in the family was going away that weekend. See, my parents and Aunt Cecelia had been invited to this big family wedding in Massachusetts. But it was the kind of wedding that kids aren\u2019t invited to. (Squirt, our baby",

I realized that singing was probably just the kids\u2019 way of working out some of their heebie\u2011jeebies. (I love that term! It\u2019s much more fun than \u201canxiety,\u201d or \u201capprehension.\u201d) But even though I knew it was good for them, I couldn\u2019t stand the racket they were making. Suddenly, I had an idea. It was a good one, too, and I acted on it right away. I whistled loudly to get their attention. \u201cHey, kids,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s play chorus. We can take turns being the conductor, okay? I\u2019ll go first to show you how.\u201d\n\nThey looked up at me expectantly. I raised my arms. \u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re going to sing the same song,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd not \u2018Jingle Bells.\u2019 It\u2019s too hot and muggy to sing Christmas carols. All right, let\u2019s try something simple, like \u2014\u201d\n\nBart raised his hand. \u201cHow about \u2018We\u2019re Off to See the Wizard\u2019?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d I said. \u201cReady, everyone?\u201d I got them started, and then after two verses I tapped my little brother David Michael on the shoulder. \u201cYou conduct now,\u201d I whispered to him. He took over, and I leaned back in my seat and sighed. Listening to nine voices singing the same song was about a hundred times better than listening to nine different songs.\n\n\u201cNice going, Kristy,\u201d said Bart.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Charlie from the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cThanks!\u201d\n\nWhew. Once again, I\u2019d had an idea that saved the day. I don\u2019t mean to sound conceated, but that happens to me a lot. Getting ideas, I mean. I don\u2019t know where they come from; they just pop into my brain all by themselves. My stepfather, Watson Brewer, calls it \u201cthe eternal mystery of the creative process.\u201d I call it luck.",

          "text": "I guess I should introduce myself. My name\u2019s Kristy Thomas (Kristin Amanda Thomas, if you want to be formal), and I\u2019m thirteen and in the eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School, which is in the little town of Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I have medium\u2011length brown hair, brown eyes, and I\u2019m short for my age. I\u2019m not one of those girls you sometimes see who look like they stepped out of a fashion magazine. In fact, I\u2019m the opposite of that. I don\u2019t care much about how clothes look. I just want them to be comfortable. That\u2019s why I usually wear jeans and turtlenecks and running shoes.\n\nThat Saturday, in the van, it was way too hot for jeans and a turtleneck. I was really glad I\u2019d worn shorts and a T\u2011shirt instead. On my T\u2011shirt was written the name of my softball team; it said Krushers, in red. Bart was wearing a shirt that looked a lot like it, except his said Bashers. That\u2019s the name of his team. Some of the kids in the van \u2014 Jerry, Joey, Chris, and Patty \u2014 are Bashers. The others \u2014 David Michael, Buddy, Karen, Jackie, and Nicky \u2014 are Krushers. But for that day, all nine kids were Krashers. That\u2019s right, Krashers. Bart and I had combined some of the players on each of our teams to make an \u201call\u2011star\u201d squad that could play teams from other towns. That\u2019s why we were traveling the thirty miles to Redfield.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the Krashers\u2019 first game together. But it was the first one with a new line\u2011up. Bart and I had made some changes and substitutions since the last time the Krashers played. Still, I thought we had a good, strong team. I looked around the crowded van and smiled at the kids as they sang.\n\nSuddenly, I thought of something kind of funny. Twelve people were in that van, and a third of them were in my family! There was Charlie, who\u2019s seventeen, and the oldest kid in my family. And there was me. And there was David Michael, my seven\u2011year\u2011old brother. And finally there was Karen Brewer, my stepsister. (She\u2019s the one who had been singing \u201cDoe, a deer, a female deer.\u201d) She\u2019s seven, and a lot of fun. She doesn\u2019t live at my house full\u2011time; she and her little brother, Andrew, live with us only on alternate weekends and for two weeks in the summer. The rest of the time they live with their mother, Watson Brewer\u2019s first wife. She\u2019s married again, too, to a man named Seth.\n\nI forgot to mention that my family is kind of complicated.\n\nSee, my father walked out on my family soon after David Michael was born. He left my mom with four kids to take care of! (I have another brother, named Sam, who\u2019s fifteen. He wasn\u2019t in the van that day.) My mom\u2019s a strong woman, and she hung in there and kept the family going. I really admire her for that. Then, not too long ago, she met Watson Brewer. A nice guy (even though I didn\u2019t exactly love him at first sight), with a station wagon and a bald spot on his head. He also had a lot of money! Truth. And so, when they ended up getting married, my family moved into Watson. It\u2019s across town from where I used to live, which is too bad, but it\u2019s huge and really comfortable, which is nice.\n\nIf the house weren\u2019t as big as it is, I don\u2019t know what we\u2019d do, because our family just seems to keep growing",

          "text": "When did it all start? I guess I\u2019d have to say it was a few weeks ago, when I was hanging out at my best friend\u2019s house after school one day. Claudia and I were in her room, looking over a pile of fashion magazines. We were passing time until our club meeting started that afternoon. We belong to this great club called the Baby\u2011sitters Club, or BSC, which is made up of people who love to baby\u2011sit \u2014 but I\u2019ll tell you about that later. First, more about Claudia.\n\nMy best friend is Claudia Kishi. I\u2019ve never had a friend quite like her. She and I agree on almost everything, and we are so much alike that it\u2019s sometimes hard to believe. We\u2019re both thirteen and in the eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. We both love to shop. We both love wild, sophisticated clothes, interesting accessories, and cool makeup. We both love to try out the latest hairstyles. And we\u2019re both a little boy\u2011crazy.\n\n\u201cStacey, can you believe this guy?\u201d Claud held up a magazine, open to an ad for a new men\u2019s cologne. A guy was lying on some rocks near an ocean, his face turned toward the sun. He was wearing bleached blue jeans and a white shirt.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a hunk,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I think he\u2019s more your type. You can have him.\u201d\n\nClaudia giggled. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cI appreciate that.\u201d She leaned over the magazine again and flipped some more pages.\n\nI should say that, while Claudia and I are an awful lot alike, we\u2019re not exactly alike. I think that\u2019s what makes our friendship work: we enjoy our similarities and our differences. Here\u2019s how we\u2019re different: I have blonde hair that\u2019s usually pretty curly (I perm it) and blue eyes, while Claud has straight black hair and dark, almond\u2011shaped eyes (she\u2019s Japanese\u2011American). I\u2019m an only child, and Claudia has an older sister. My parents are divorced, and hers are still together. Claudia has lived all her life in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, the small town where we both live now. But I grew up in New York City, and in some ways I still think of myself as a city girl.\n\nIn fact, I visit New York as often as I can, because that\u2019s where my father lives.",

I\u2019d better be, since I\u2019ll have to be careful about what I eat for the rest of my life. See, having diabetes means that my body can\u2019t process sugar the way it should. Eating desserts or sweets can make me very, very sick. But just avoiding sweets isn\u2019t enough with diabetes. I also have to check my blood sugar frequently, to make sure it isn\u2019t too high or too low. And I have to give myself daily shots of insulin, which is something my body should be producing by itself.\n\nSounds awful, right? Well, it was, at first. But now I guess I\u2019ve gotten used to the routine, and it doesn\u2019t bother me much. I think the part about the shots sounds the worst to most people, but they\u2019re no big deal. The part that bothers me most is having to be so strict about what I eat. Once in a while I\u2019d just like to be able to forget about keeping track of every single thing I put in my mouth.\n\nStill, I\u2019d never go back to eating tons of junk food. I\u2019ll leave that to Claudia. She loves the stuff.\n\nMaybe someday scientists will discover her, and she\u2019ll become the first proof that a human being can actually survive on a diet of Ring Dings, Cheetos, and Three Musketeers bars.\n\n\u201cMrs. Kishi,\u201d the scientists will say as they interview Claudia\u2019s mother, \u201chow did she do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine,\u201d Mrs. Kishi will say. \u201cI tried to tell her that junk food was terrible for her, and I tried to keep her from eating it. But she ate it anyway, and I guess she proved me wrong.\n\nOf course, in reality, Mrs. Kishi has no idea that Claud eats so much junk food. Officially, Claudia is not supposed to be eating any at all. That\u2019s why she hides her Ruffles under the bed, her Twinkies behind a curtain, and her Mars bars in her soc",

          "text": "Claudia, what on earth are you doing? asked my older sister Janine, when she saw me sprawled out on the living room floor, near the fireplace.\n\nReading the paper, I said. What does it look like I\u2019m doing? Janine is a genius (for real!), but sometimes she doesn\u2019t seem very bright at all.\n\nNot just the paper, said Janine. You\u2019re reading The New York Times. The Sunday New York Times.\n\nI know that, I said, with dignity.\n\nBut you never read the paper, said Janine. Except perhaps to check your horoscope or something.\n\nJanine was right, I had to admit it. I don\u2019t usually read our local newspaper, the Stoneybrook News, much less the Sunday New York Times. Normally, the tiny print and serious\u2011looking columns of that huge, thick newspaper put me off. I\u2019m not big on current events. Or history. Or politics.\n\nBut there was something in the Times that Sunday that I was really interested in reading about. So I was wading through page after page of dense black type, trying to find a certain article.\n\nIf you knew me the way my friends know me, you would be able to guess what that article was about. Art, you\u2019d say, without thinking twice.\n\nAnd you\u2019d be right. I may not be interested in geography or math or any of those other boring (to me) subjects, but I am very, very interested in art. I love to look at it. I love to read about it. And most of all, I like to make it. I like to draw and paint and sculpt. I like to make jewelry. I like to work with papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9. I\u2019m never happier than when I\u2019m creating something that\u2019s totally me.\n\nTotally me means totally Claudia Kishi. And since I can\u2019t show you a piece of my artwork, I guess I\u2019ll just have to tell you about myself instead. I\u2019m thirteen years old and I am in the eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. That\u2019s in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where I\u2019ve lived all my life. It\u2019s a small quiet town with lots of nice old houses. As for my looks, I have long, straight black hair and dark almond\u2011shaped eyes. In case you haven\u2019t guessed, I am Asian (Japanese\u2011American), and so are both of my parents.\n\nMy father is a partner in an investment firm in Stamford, which is the city nearest to our town. Don\u2019t ask me what he does, exactly, because I\u2019ve never really understood it. It has something to do with money and numbers, that\u2019s all I know. My mother is the head librarian at the Stoneybrook Public Library. And my sister, as I told you before, is a genius.\n\nJanine has always been smart. For example, she taught herself to read before she went to kindergarten. And now, even though she\u2019s only sixteen and a junior in high school, she takes classes at Stoneybrook University. Classes like physics and chemistry. And she gets all A\u2019s.\n\nI get A\u2019s, too. But not in classes like English or social studies. I get A\u2019s in art. I\u2019m not going to tell you my other grades, except to say that they\u2019re not so hot. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m dumb. My teachers \u2014 and my parents \u2014 are always telling me that I have great \"potential,\" and that if I \"applied myself\" I could do better in school. But I\u2019d rather \"apply myself\" to a painting in progress, or to a new sculpture technique.\n\nI mean, so what if I can\u2019t spell too well, or tell you what happened in the year 1016? Did Van\u00a0Gogh know how to calculate what x equals? Probably not, and it sure didn\u2019t affect his painting. I\u2019ve tried to get this point across to my parents, and I think they are beginning to understand. They are very supportive of my interest in art. Still, I know they wish I would do better in school.\n\nThey also wish I would a) stop eating junk food and b) stop reading Nancy\u00a0Drew books. They don\u2019t like me to eat junk food because they say it\u2019s bad for me, but I have to say I haven\u2019t noticed any problems with my health. I can eat Cheetos and Milk Duds all day long, and I never gain weight or get pimples. I\u2019m just lucky, I guess. As for the Nancy\u00a0Drew books, my parents think I should be reading more \"challenging\" material. But I love mysteries, and that\u2019s all there is to it. So I hide my chips and candy and books all over my room, and I figure what my parents don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt them.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d have to say that my family is pretty cool.",

I love to put outrageous outfits together, and I hate looking like everyone else. I mean, I do wear trendy clothes, like leggings and big slouchy socks and Doc\u00a0Marten boots, but I always add my own touches so that I stand out from the crowd. For instance, earrings I\u2019ve made myself, or a big belt that I found in a thrift store. I also like to play around with my hair. One day I\u2019ll wear it in a French braid, and the next day it\u2019ll be in a ponytail on the top of my head.\n\nThat Sunday, my hair was in a long braid hanging down one side of my head, with red ribbons threaded into it. I was wearing a red\u2011and\u2011white striped shirt that hung down almost to the knees, red leggings, and black high\u2011top sneakers. Even though I wasn\u2019t planning on going anywhere that afternoon, I had put some thought into my outfit. That\u2019s just the way I am.\n\nI turned the pages of the Arts and Leisure section, hunting for the article I had heard about. My art teacher had mentioned it during class on Friday, and told us to look out for it.\n\n\"What are you looking for?\" asked Janine, who had settled into the couch with the Book Review section.\n\nThere\u2019s supposed to be an article in here about the new museum, I answered. They\u2019re having a special show next week.\n\nThe new museum is one that recently opened in Stoneybrook. I\u2019ve been",

I headed down the long, tiled hall that leads to the kitchen. My father was standing by the sink, drinking a glass of carrot juice he had just whipped up. 'Bye, Dad,' I said, giving him a hug. 'See you later, Sunshine,' he said, hugging me back. (Sunshine is his baby name for me. Ugh.) 'You be careful now, okay?' 'I will,' I said. 'Don't worry.'

Then I buckled my seat belt, leaned back, and relaxed. It was a beautiful midwinter day in California, the 'Golden State,' and I was on my way to the beach. What could be better? I guess I should stop here and introduce myself. My name is Dawn Schafer, and I'm thirteen years old and in the eighth grade. I have long blonde hair and blue eyes. I guess my life might seem a little confusing to anybody else, but to me it makes sense. Let's see, how can I explain everything? Maybe I'll practice something I've been learning in English class, and make an outline. Have you ever been asked to do that? You know, with roman numerals and letters and everything? It's not easy, but it can be a good way to sort out a lot of information. So, here goes: I. Sharon Porter, my mother, is born in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. A. Grows up. B. Has high-school sweetheart, Richard Spier, but does not marry him. C. Moves to California, and marries Jack Schafer. D. Has two children, Dawn (that's me) and Jeff (my younger brother). II. My parents get a divorce. A. My mother, Jeff, and I move back to Stoneybrook. B. My father stays in California. C. I make good friends and join a special baby-sitting club (the BSC). D. Jeff is unhappy in Connecticut, and moves back to live with my father. III. Mary Anne Spier (my new best friend) and I find out that her father (a widower) and my mom were those high-school sweethearts I mentioned before. A. We set them up and they start dating again. B. They (surprise!) fall in love. IV. My mother remarries. A. My new best friend becomes my sister. B. We all live happily in our old Connecticut farmhouse. V. I really, really miss my dad, Jeff, and California. A. I decide to go back to California for a few months. B. Here I am! Phew! Pretty complicated, right? Just be glad I didn't put in all the other little things, which would have been listed under the As and Bs as 1s, 2s, and 3s. I could even have put in 1as, bs, and cs. But that would have made the outline about ten pages long. Anyway, I think you get the idea.\"",

And who wants to be sad when she's about to hit the beach? I was excited about going surfing that day, and nothing could ruin my mood. Sunny and I started to take surfing lessons not too long ago, when we heard that a big surfing competition was coming up. Practically all the kids at school are planning to enter at least one event, and everybody's busy preparing for it. I haven't surfed in a long time, and I was never all that good at it when I did do it, but I thought being involved in the competition would be a nice way to feel that I fit in with my old California friends. As it turned out, this time around I just loved surfing. I wouldn't have kept it up if I didn't, since 'fitting in' is not as important to me as being happy with myself. Anyway, surfing is great!

I guess that sounds silly. If you're feeling down, watching a movie that makes you cry might not seem like the most brilliant thing to do. But somehow it made sense to me. I figured a good cry might make me feel better.\n\nThe only problem was that it hadn't worked. Oh, there was no doubt that I'd had a good cry. But as I headed for the bathroom to rinse off my face with a little cold water, I realized that I didn't feel one bit better.\n\nI had been lost in the romantic world of Roman Holiday, but when I came back to Earth, nothing had changed. It was still a dismal, cold, gray day. I still felt bored and restless. I still missed Dawn and Logan, and Mallory, too. And it still wasn't time for me to head over to Claudia's for a BSC meeting.",

All of the people in it are my closest friends, except for one. And that one happens to be my boyfriend! His name is Logan Bruno, and he's extremely sweet and very, very cute. In fact, he looks just like my favorite actor Cam Geary, with deep blue eyes and a shy smile. He's from Louisville, Kentucky, and he speaks with the most delicious Southern drawl. Dawn, Mallory, and Claudia are members, too, and I'll explain more about them later.\n\nAnyway, I love the BSC, and I always look forward to our meetings. But that day, I was really looking forward to our meeting. It seemed like the only bright spot in a very dull day.\n\nI'm pretty emotional, as you've probably guessed. My friends tell me I'm the most sensitive person they've ever met. I cry easily, even when I'm not watching Roman Holiday.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I'm a sad person. Usually I'm cheerful and usually I really enjoy life. Being a sensitive person has its ups and downs, though. The up part is that people seem to find me easy to talk to, and when somebody is happy I can share his happiness. As for the down part of being sensitive, well, you know the end of the movie The Wizard of Oz? When everybody in Oz is saying good-bye to Dorothy? The Tin Man whispers \"Now I know I have a heart, because it's breaking.\" (Of course, I go through a box of Kleenex during that scene.) What I'm trying to say is that being sensitive leaves me open to a lot of wonderful emotions, but it also leaves me open to some not-so-pleasant feelings.\n\nAnd lately, I have definitely been feeling not-so-pleasant. As I said, I miss Logan and Dawn and Mallory. I miss Logan because he's on the volleyball team, and the team is in the middle of a tournament these days, and Logan is constantly busy with practices or games. Boo. I mean, of course I hope the team does well, but what about me? I miss my boyfriend.",

See, my mother died when I was just a baby. I never knew her, so I don't exactly miss her, but sometimes I do miss having a mom. I was brought up by my father, and basically I have to give him credit for doing a decent job. For a while, he was incredibly strict about such things as how I dressed and what my room looked like. But these days he's a little more easygoing.\n\nSo, there you have my dad, a Connecticut widower with one daughter. (I'm an only child.)\n\nEnter Sharon Schafer, Dawn's mom. Like my dad, Sharon grew up in Stoneybrook. In fact, Sharon and my dad used to date each other when they were in high school.\n\nDad lost track of Sharon when she went off to college in California. She got married out there and had two kids. Then, when her marriage broke up, she moved back to Stoneybrook, bringing her kids with her. That's when she and Dad met up again, all because Dawn and I had become friends and found out about our parents' high school romance. It sounds complicated, but it isn't, really. Sharon and my dad (his name's Richard, by the way) fell in love soon after they started dating again, and not too long after that, they got married.\n\nSharon plus Richard equals instant family! For so long, it had just been Dad and me. But all of a sudden I had a stepmother, a stepsister who was already my best friend, and a step-brother. That's Jeff, Dawn's ten-year-old brother. I don't know Jeff very well, because he didn't live in Stoneybrook for long. He had a hard time adjusting to life in Connecticut, and he ended up going back to California to live with his dad.",

It wasn't my first A or anything (I'm a pretty decent student), but I felt especially proud of it. I've always been good at math, but this class was something new. Math for Real Life, it was called. It was part of a program at school called Short Takes, in which all the students in every grade take the same special class. This is how it works: You study a subject intensively for a short period of time, and you learn awesome stuff that isn't usually taught in school. For instance, one really cool Short Takes class was Modern Living, in which pairs of students had to \"adopt\" an egg and pretend it was their baby. We've also had Career Class, and special health and civics classes.\n\nMath for Real Life was my favorite Short Takes class yet. In it, we had learned how to balance a checkbook, make a grocery budget, and figure out mortgage payments. We also learned how to play the stock market, which was the best part. Mr. Schubert told us that we each had (an imaginary) five thousand dollars to invest, and then he showed us how to read the financial pages and pick out stocks to buy. The report I had just gotten back showed the results of my investing, which were pretty impressive, if I do say so myself.",

If you want or need anything, you can find it in New York, usually at half price. I know how to track down all the bargains, whether I'm in New York or Stoneybrook. I love fashion, for example; I really enjoy dressing in trendy, sophisticated outfits. But I don't just buy the first thing I see. I make a game of it: shopping around, checking prices, figuring out how to get the most for my money. Like, when I see a pair of jeans I want, I note the cost and move on.

She always looks fabulous, and she never looks just like everyone else. She'll pair a long white shirt with a colorful vest, accessorize with handmade jewelry, pull her hair up into an outrageous ponytail, and look like a million dollars.\n\nClaud's gorgeous to begin with, anyway. She's Japanese-American and very exotic-looking, with her long black hair and almond-shaped eyes. On the other hand, I'm your basic blue-eyed blonde. The other differences between me and Claud? For starters, she thinks being in math class is like being in a torture chamber. School is not Claudia's favorite thing, to say the least. (Her older sister, Janine, is a certified genius. Honest!

          "text": "I\\'ll probably always remember that Wednesday as The Day I Found Out It Was Going to Be an Interesting Summer. It was a hot day \u2014 a very hot day, with no breeze and a sky that looked almost white. I was baby-sitting for David Michael and Emily Michelle, my little brother and sister, and the three of us were sitting on the front stoop eating sandwiches.\\n\\n\\\"It\\'s hot,\\\" complained David Michael, wiping his forehead with a jelly-smeared hand.\\n\\n\\\"Hot!\\\" repeated a pink-cheeked Emily Michelle, who was sitting between David Michael and me.\\n\\n\\\"I know.\\\" I sighed. \\\"It sure is.\\\" Summer vacation had only started a couple of weeks ago, and already I was starting to think school wasn't such a bad thing. I mean, it's nice to have a break from classes, but sometimes summer vacation can seem awfully long and boring. Long and boring and hot.\\n\\nMy name\\'s Kristy Thomas, or if you want to be formal, Kristin Amanda Thomas. I\\'m thirteen, and I go to Stoneybrook Middle School, which is in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I\\'ve lived all my life in Stoneybrook, and it\\'s a nice little town. But guess what? It can be boring.\\n\\nOh, I keep pretty busy. I\\'m president of this terrific club, for one thing. It\\'s called the BSC, for Baby-sitters Club, and it\\'s really more like a business than a club. But more about that later. I also coach a softball team, Krist\\'s Krushers, for kids who are too young or otherwise not ready for Little League. And I also stay busy baby-sitting for my younger brothers and sisters and keeping track of the rest of my family, which is pretty humongous and complicated.\\n\\nI have two older brothers, Sam and Charlie. Sam\\'s fifteen, and Charlie\\'s seventeen, and they\\'re okay as far as big brothers go. They\\'re both involved in their own things, mostly school activities. Otherwise, Charlie mainly works on his car, which we call the Junk Bucket (it\\'s not exactly new, as you might\\'ve guessed), and as for Sam, well, he\\'s mostly interested in girls.\\n\\nDavid Michael, my younger brother, is seven and a half. He has dark hair, like the rest of my family, but his hair has these soft little curls that are the envy of all my friends. David Michael is a great kid: he\\'s serious and deliberate and he\\'s a little klutzy at sports, but he\\'s also very loving and has a terrific sense of humor.\\n\\nWhen David Michael was just a baby, my father walked out on our family. I remember my dad, but not all that well. He was never very involved as a parent, and I guess that\\'s partly why he left \u2014 he just wasn\\'t interested in being a daddy. He hardly stays in touch with us at all. In fact, I\\'m not even sure exactly where he is. Last I heard, he was in California, but for all I know he could be in Alaska or Japan by now.\\n\\nI don\\'t think my mom has ever forgiven my father for what he did, but she never sat around whining about how badly he treated us. My mom is a very strong woman, and when my dad left she knew she\\'dnt have any spare time to spend complaining. Instead, she worked hard to raise my brothers and me by herself, and I\\'ve always admired her for doing it as well as she did.\\n\\nAfter years of being a single mother, my mom finally got a good break. She met and fell in love with a really nice guy named Watson Brewer, who happens to be mega-rich. Watson is now my stepfather, and while I wasn\\'t totally crazy about him at first, he\\'s really grown on me.\\n\\nNow Mom still works, and my brothers and I live in his huge house (it\\'s more like a mansion, really), which is way across town from where I used to live. Our family has grown, too. I now have a sweet little stepbrother named Andrew, who\\'s four, and a seven-year-old stepsister named Karen. She\\'s a real bundle of energy. Karen and Andrew live with us every other month now. (It\\'s a new arrangement.)\\n\\nMy other new sibling is Emily Michelle, who\\'s two and a half. Mom and Watson adopted her not that long ago. Emily, who\\'s Vietnamese, is awfully cute, with her shiny black hair in bangs across her forehead and her pudgy cheeks. She\\'s had a hard time learning to speak English, but she\\'s coming along with it lately.\\n\\nAfter Mom and Watson adopted Emily, my grandmother Nannie came to live with us, too, just to help out. Nannie probably has more energy than the rest of us put together; she never sits still. She has this great old car we call the Pink Clinker, and she\\'s always taking off in it. She goes bowling, to aqua-aerobics classes, poker tournaments \u2014 you name it, she does it.\\n\\nSo that\\'s my family! Oh, I almost forgot to mention the non-human members of the Thomas-Brewer clan: we have a Bernese Mountain dog puppy named Shannon, and a cranky old cat named Boo-Boo. Plus, Karen and Andrew have a rat and a hermit crab, which travel back and forth with them, and a couple of goldfish.\\n\\nAnyway, you can see how my family and my other activities might keep me busy. But somehow, on that hot summer Wednesday, I was worried that I wasn\\'t going to be busy enough.",

I\u2019ve lived all my life in Stoneybrook, and it\u2019s a nice little town. But guess what? It can be boring.\n\nOh, I keep pretty busy. I\u2019m president of this terrific club, for one thing. It\u2019s called the BSC, for Baby\u2011sitters Club, and it\u2019s really more like a business than a club. But more about that later. I also coach a softball team, Kristy\u2019s Krushers, for kids who are too young or otherwise not ready for Little League. And I also stay busy baby\u2011sitting for my younger brothers and sisters and keeping track of the rest of my family, which is pretty humongous and complicated.\n\nI have two older brothers, Sam and Charlie. Sam\u2019s fifteen, and Charlie\u2019s seventeen, and they\u2019re okay as far as big brothers go. They\u2019re both involved in their own things, mostly school activities. Otherwise, Charlie mainly works on his car, which we call the Junk Bucket (it\u2019s not exactly new, as you might\u2019ve guessed), and as for Sam, well, he\u2019s mostly interested in girls.\n\nDavid Michael, my younger brother, is seven and a half. He has dark hair, like the rest of my family, but his hair has these soft little curls that are the envy of all my friends. David Michael is a great kid: he\u2019s serious and deliberate and he\u2019s a little klutzy at sports, but he\u2019s also very loving and has a terrific sense of humor.\n\nWhen David Michael was just a baby, my father walked out on our family. I remember my dad, but not all that well. He was never very involved as a parent, and I guess that\u2019s partly why he left \u2014 he just wasn\u2019t interested in being a daddy. He hardly stays in touch with us at all. In fact, I\u2019m not even sure exactly where he is. Last I heard, he was in California, but for all I know he could be in Alaska or Japan by now.\n\nI don\u2019t think my mom has ever forgiven my father for what he did, but she never sat around whining about how badly he treated us. My mom is a very strong woman, and when my dad left she knew she wouldn\u2019t have any spare time to spend complaining. Instead, she worked hard to raise my brothers and me by herself, and I\u2019ve always admired her for doing it as well as she did.\n\nAfter years of being a single mother, my mom finally got a good break. She met and fell in love with a really nice guy named Watson Brewer, who happens to be mega\u2011rich. Watson is now my stepfather, and while I wasn\u2019t totally crazy about him at first, he\u2019s really grown on me.\n\nNow Mom still works, and my brothers and I live in his huge house (it\u2019s more like a mansion, really), which is way across town from where I used to live. Our family has grown, too. I now have a sweet little stepbrother named Andrew, who\u2019s four, and a seven\u2011year\u2011old stepsister named Karen. She\u2019s a real bundle of energy. Karen and Andrew live with us every other month now. (It\u2019s a new arrangement.)\n\nMy other new sibling is Emily Michelle, who\u2019s two and a half. Mom and Watson adopted her not that long ago. Emily, who\u2019s Vietnamese, is awfully cute, with her shiny black hair in bangs across her forehead and her pudgy cheeks. She\u2019s had a hard time learning to speak English, but she\u2019s coming along with it lately.\n\nAfter Mom and Watson adopted Emily, my grandmother Nannie came to live with us, too, just to help out. Nannie probably has more energy than the rest of us put together; she never sits still. She has this great old car we call the Pink Clinker, and she\u2019s always taking off in it. She goes bowling, to aqua\u2011aerobics classes, poker tournaments \u2014 you name it, she does it.\n\nSo that\u2019s my family! Oh, I almost forgot to mention the non\u2011human members of the Thomas\u2011Brewer clan: we have a Bernese Mountain dog puppy named Shannon, and a cranky old cat named Boo\u2011Boo. Plus, Karen and Andrew have a rat and a hermit crab, which travel back and forth with them, and a couple of goldfish.\n\nAnyway, you can see how my family and my other activities might keep me busy. But somehow, on that hot summer Wednesday, I was worried that I wasn\u2019t going to be busy enough.",

Besides, you're going to get jelly on my camera if you're not careful.\" He reached out for the camera. I put the lens cap back on and handed it to him. He turned it over in his hands. \"What a great piece of equipment,\" he said.

          "text": "Mr. Geist was my photography teacher. He was one of the best teachers I'd ever had at SMS. (That's Stoneybrook Middle School, which is in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, the town where I live.) Taking photography with Mr. Geist made going to summer school not just bearable, but totally great. At first, when my parents insisted I take math over again this summer, I was very bummed out. But then we made a deal. If I had to take math, I would also be allowed to take another course, just for fun. At the time, I didn't know just how much fun photography would be. But the fact is that Mr. Geist had opened up a new world for me, and lately I couldn't think about anything but photography.\n\nYou've probably already figured out that my name is Claudia Kishi, and that I have an older sister named Janine who is incredibly smart. (She's a genius, in fact.) And you might have guessed that my family is pretty close, because of the way we were all sitting down to breakfast together. And maybe you've also realized that I can become totally wrapped up in things like photography. Well, you're right on all counts, especially the last one.\n\nI've loved art for as long as I can remember. Other kids would do a little crayoning and then move on to playing with dolls or riding bikes. Me? I moved from crayoning to finger-painting to papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and then back to crayoning. For me, there's nothing like the feeling you get from creating something, something that's yours alone. And now, this summer, I had discovered a whole new way to create.\n\nFirst I'd learned how to use a camera \u2014 a real camera, not the automatic kind you take snapshots with. And while I hate math, somehow I had no problem figuring out exposures and shutter speeds. Then I'd learned about the elements of a good picture. Mr. Geist had taught me how to consider composition, textures, forms, and tones so that I could produce not just snapshots, but pieces of art that would really have an effect on the viewer. And finally, I had learned how to make magic.\n\nThat's right, magic.\n\nHave you ever worked in a darkroom? If you have, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, you'll just have to take my word for it. What happens in that lightless place is pure magic. I'll never forget the first time I put a plain white piece of paper into a tray of developer and saw the image form itself in front of my eyes. I felt like a wizard!\n\nMy dad, who used to do a lot of photography himself, had noticed how excited I was about my class. \"Tell you what,\" he'd said, one night after supper. \"How about if we make you a temporary darkroom in the bathroom between your room and Janine's?\" He'd rounded up all the equipment \u2014 some borrowed, some rented, some bought \u2014 and helped me set up my very own wizard's den.\n\nI'd been spending every spare minute in there ever since.\n\nWell, maybe not every minute. As always, I'm also spending plenty of time on one of my other loves, baby-sitting. I belong to this cool club called the BSC, or Baby-sitters Club. My best pal Stacey McGill is in it, too, and so are a bunch of my other good friends. We all have different interests, but one thing we have in common is that we adore kids. That's why the club (it's actually more of a business) works so well. But more about that later.\n\nBack to that Friday morning, when my family kept me from \"catching the moment.\"",

Soon after that my dad took off for his job, which has something to do with stocks and bonds and money. (I've never quite understood what he does, but apparently he's very good at it.)\n\nJanine took one last sip of juice and picked up her backpack.\n\n\"Ready to crunch those numbers?\" I asked, grinning. This summer, Janine had signed up for a work\u2011study program that's part of this supersonic academic fast track she's on. She's still in high school, but she takes a lot of college classes. For summer school, she was taking what she called a \"light\" schedule. Light for an Einstein like her, maybe.\n\nJanine's work\u2011study program involved helping one of her professors with some research. When I first heard that, I thought she might be doing something halfway interesting, like teaching rats how to go through a maze. But no, all she was doing was sitting in front of a computer for hours at a time, typing in numbers. According to Janine, it was \"utterly fascinating.\" I'd rather watch bread get s",

          "text": "\"Huge muscles,\" said Jeff. \"I mean, really huge. Like, this big!\" He held his hands apart to show me. \"And a totally gruesome mask.\"\n\n\"And all in red, right?\" I asked, grinning. \"Or did you change that to purple?\"\n\n\"I think I've decided on green,\" said Jeff, after deliberating for a second. \"Green is the most monsterish.\"\n\nMy younger brother Jeff is ten, and if anybody knows what makes a monster monsterish, it's him. He and I were sitting at the kitchen table that October afternoon, eating the nachos our housekeeper, Mrs. Bruen, had prepared for an after-school snack, and talking about Jeff's Halloween costume. He had a sketchpad in front of him, and he was drawing costume ideas with his markers.\n\nMy name's Dawn Schafer. I'm a little old for trick-or-treating \u2014 I'm thirteen and in the eighth grade \u2014 but Jeff still gets really excited about it. He loves to create elaborate costumes, and he and his friends spend hours making game plans about which neighborhoods to visit for the best \"booty.\" When the trick-or-treating is over, Jeff carefully counts and organizes his loot, and then he hoards it, eating only a little bit each day in order to make it last.\n\nSometimes, when he's feeling extra generous, he offers me a Snickers bar or a pack of Sweet-Tarts, but I always turn him down. I can't stand junk food, candy included. I don't mind if he eats it once in a while. That's his business. (He usually eats pretty healthy stuff.) But I hate the idea of putting refined sugars and weird chemicals in my body.\n\n\"What was the best Halloween costume you ever had?\" Jeff asked, helping himself to a nacho. A long string of cheese stretched between the nacho and the plate, and Jeff carefully reeled it in and piled it on top of his chip.\n\nI thought for a minute. \"I guess it would have to be Pippi Longstocking,\" I said, smiling at the memory. \"I must have been about seven or eight. Mom braided my hair and put wires in it so it stuck straight out, and we painted freckles all over my nose. And I wore this hilarious-looking pair of Dad's shoes. You know how Pippi always wears those big shoes?\"\n\n\"What was I that year?\" Jeff asked.\n\n\"You were a mouse,\" I said.\n\nJeff made a face. \"A mouse? How nerdy.\"\n\n\"No, you were cute,\" I said. \"You were a totally adorable little mouse. Don't you remember? You've seen the pictures. Mom must have shot a whole roll of us in those costumes.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah,\" said Jeff.\n\nThen, all of a sudden, we both stopped talking. The only noise in the house came from the living room, where Mrs. Bruen was vacuuming. I could guess what Jeff was thinking about, because it was probably pretty close to what I was thinking about. We were both \"seeing\" those pictures: a young Dawn, with the same long, pale blonde hair and blue eyes, and an even younger Jeff, with matching blue eyes and that familiar, funny cowlick in his hair.\n\nOur eyes and hair are still the same, but everything else has changed since those pictures were taken.\n\n\"That was a long time ago, Jeff,\" I said gently.\n\n\"It sure was,\" said Jeff, looking sad. \"Sometimes it's hard to remember what it was like when Mom and Dad were still together.\"\n\nOur parents are divorced. For now, Jeff and I are both living with my dad in the town where we grew up: Palo City, California. That's outside of Anaheim, where Disneyland is. My mom lives in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, which is where she grew up, and where our grandparents, Granny and Pop-Pop, still live. Jeff and I both moved out to Connecticut with Mom after the divorce, but Jeff never adjusted to life in the East. He ended up coming back here to live with our dad.\n\nI adjusted to Connecticut just fine. I made tons of friends, partly because I joined this cool club called the BSC (or Baby-sitters Club), which I'll explain more about later, and one best friend. Her name's Mary Anne Spier, and now she's my stepsister, too, because my mom married her dad!\n\nAnyway, while I did love living in Connecticut, I also found that I missed Jeff and my dad tremendously. That's why I decided to come back out here and live with them for a while.\n\nNow, being in California again has been pretty wonderful. I belong to a club here, too: it's called the We \u2665 Kids Club, and all my best California friends are in it, including my oldest best friend, Sunny Winslow. She and I grew up together. I love our house out here: it's all on one floor, built around a courtyard, and it has these long, cool, tiled halls and skylights in every room. Sunny calls it Casa Schafer. (That just means \"Schafer House\" in Spanish.) Mrs. Bruen keeps the house spotless, and she's also a wonderful cook. My school is great. And I've even grown to like Carol, this woman my dad is engaged to. (We had our ups and downs at first, to put it mildly.)\n\nBut.\n\nYou knew there was a \"but\" coming, didn't you?\n\nHere it is: But even though I love California, I am not totally, totally happy here. I miss my mom like crazy, and I hate being away from Mary Anne and my other friends in the BSC. So, I know it won't be long before I go back to Connecticut to live. And of course, when I do, I'll miss everybody out here!\n\nBeing a divorced kid is never easy. For me, it means my life is always like a puzzle with one lost piece. It means I'm always missing somebody or someplace.\n\nI don't mean to complain. The truth is, there's a good side to my bi-coastal life. I have two sets of wonderful friends, two great houses to live in (the one in Stoneybrook is an old, old farmhouse that's probably haunted!), and two parents who are probably happier now than they were when they were together. That's a whole lot more than some people have!\n\n\"Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9?\" Jeff asked, interrupting my thoughts.\n\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\n\"Do you think I should build the muscles out of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9?\" He showed me the sketch he'd been making.\n\n\"Foam rubber might be easier,\" I said, turning the sketch to look at it. \"You could stuff your costume with it.\"\n\n\"Great idea!\" Jeff said. He took the sketch back and started to ",

Suddenly, she got this faraway look in her eyes. \"Je n'ai jamais oubli\u00e9 Paris.\"\n\n\"Mom, I never knew you spoke French,\" I said. \"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"It means 'I've never forgotten Paris,' \" she said dreamily.\n\n\"Never forgotten?\" I asked. \"I didn't even know you'd ever be to France!\"\n\n\"Oh, I've been there,\" she said softly. \"I went to Paris for junior year abroad when I was in college. It was one of the most wonderful times of my life.\" She wrapped her arms around her shoulders and gave herself a little hug. \"I even fell in love,\" she said softly.\n\n\"Fell in love?\"\n\n\"Fell in love,\" she repeated. \"His name was Jean-Paul, and his father was a famous chef. I almost married him and stayed in Paris.\" My mother still looked dreamy, as if she were off in another world. I'm sure she didn't notice how stunned I was. My mouth was hanging open so wide I felt as if my jaw were about to hit the floor.\n\n\"That's awesome.\" I said. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"Oh, my mother wouldn't have it,\" she answered. \"As soon as she got wind of the idea she flew over and brought me back home.\" She sighed. \"I'll always remember Jean-Paul,\" she said.\n\nWhoa! My head was spinning. In the last three minutes I'd learned three new things about my mom:\n\n1) She knew how to speak French. (Fluently, from what I could tell.)\n\n2) She had lived in Paris. (Paris!)\n\n3) (This one is major.) She had almost married a French guy.\n\nIt was number three that was really getting to me. It wasn't just that I was having a hard time imagining my mom in Paris, young and in love. I was, but that wasn't what was weirding me out. It was this: Suddenly I was realizing that my existence was only a matter of luck. I mean, what if she had married this Jean-Paul? I, Anastasia Elizabeth McGill (call me Stacey, please!), thirteen-year-old daughter of Edward and Maureen McGill, would not exist.\n\nOr maybe I would exist in another form. Maybe I'd be the French Stacey, daughter of Maureen and Jean-Paul. I'd be tr\u00e8s sophisticated, used to dressing in Chanel and sipping coffee at caf\u00e9s.

Leaving?\" I must have sounded like somebody waking up from a dream, which in a way, I was.\n\n\"The Johanssens,\" said my mother. \"When do they leave for France?\"\n\n\"Oh, the Johanssens,\" I said, nodding. Of course. That was what had started this discussion. I'd been telling my mom about this extremely exciting thing that had happened to a girl I baby\u2011sit for.\n\nHer name's Charlotte Johanssen, and she's a favorite of mine. The Johanssens are regular clients of the BSC, which is this club I belong to, otherwise known as the Baby\u2011sitters Club. I'll explain more about it later. Anyway, Charlotte's eight, and she and I are very close; in fact, we think of each other as \"almost sisters.\" (I'm an only child, and so is she.) She's smart \u2014 she skipped a grade not long ago \u2014 and pretty (with big dark eyes, chestnut hair, and dimples), and a little shy. She used to be a lot shy, but I think I've helped her grow out of that.\n\nAnyway, Charlotte's mom, who is a doctor, had just called me to tell me the news: Charlotte's Aunt Nell (her mom's older sister), who is an incredibly wealthy and successful art dealer, was planning a two\u2011week tour of France in search of new artists. And, just for the heck of it, she'd invited her sister's family along for the ride! The Johanssens had accepted, and were taking Charlotte out of school so she could go, too.\n\nWhen Dr. Johanssen finished telling me this, she asked if I might be willing to do her a favor. For a heart\u2011pounding millisecond, I thought she was going to ask me to come along on the trip as a mother's helper.\n\nNo such luck. My assignment was much less glamorous.\n\nDr. Johanssen wanted to ask me if I'd walk Carrot, the family dog, twice a day. She also wanted me to keep an eye on the house. So instead of eating croissants in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, I was going to be house\u2011sitting and dog\u2011walking for the next two weeks.\n\n\"They're leaving in two days,\" I said, answering my mother's question. \"Can you believe it?\"\n\n\"Charlotte must be so excited,\" said my mom.\n\n\"Oh, she is! At least, according to Dr. Johanssen. I haven't talked to her yet, but I'll see her in a little while. I'm going to sit for her today while the Johanssens take care of some last minute details for their trip.\"\n\n\"Passports,\" said my mom, getting that dreamy look again. \"Luggage. Airline reservations ... Oh, I do love to travel. I envy the Johanssens so much.\"\n\n",

          "text": "\"Okay, let's see,\" I said, thinking out loud. I was sitting at my desk with a notebook open in front of me and a pen in my hand. \"If I put Matt at first, maybe Buddy can play left field.\" I jotted down some notes. \"That'll leave third base open for \u2014 who?\" I paused to think, tapping the pen against my teeth. \"Jamie? No, he's too afraid of the ball. He couldn't handle a line drive up the baseline. Nicky? Hmmm ... maybe!\" I wrote down his name.\n\n\"Kristy, can I come in?\" Karen poked her head into my room.\n\n\"Sure,\" I said, shoving my chair back. \"How was school today?\"\n\n\"Okeydokey,\" said Karen playfully, giving me a goofy smile as she adjusted her pink-rimmed glasses. Karen has blonde hair, blue eyes, and a scattering of freckles. She's seven, and in second grade. Karen is a real live wire, as her father would say. (That means she's full of energy and spunk.) Her father is Watson Brewer, my stepfather. That makes Karen my stepsister. And it's funny: Even though we're not related by blood, she and I have a lot in common. For example, I've been called a \\\"live wire\\\" more than once myself.\n\nI'm Kristy Thomas. (Kristin Amanda Thomas, according to my birth certificate.) I'm thirteen and in the eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. I've lived in Stoneybrook \u2014 that's Stoneybrook, Connecticut, in case you're wondering \u2014 all my life. As for looks, I have brown hair and brown eyes, and I'm short for my age. In fact, I'm the shortest person in my class! I'm known for that, and I'm also known for speaking my mind (some people would say, \\\"having a big mouth\\\") and for coming up with good ideas. Such as the one for the BSC, or the Baby-sitters Club. I'm president of the BSC, and all my closest friends are members. But more about that later.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Karen was asking. She was standing next to me so she could take a peek at my notebook.\n\n\"Trying to figure out the Krushers' lineup,\" I replied.\n\n\"Krushers!\" Karen said. Her eyes lit up. \"Yay! Is it almost time to start practicing?\"\n\n\"Well ... not for a while. It's only February, after all. We can't start playing until the snow on the softball field melts. Right?\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Karen, looking a little downcast. \"So why are you thinking about it now?\"\n\n\"Because it's February.\" I sighed, looking out the window at the cold, gray day. February gets me down, and I guess I'm not the only one. Everybody's kind of in the doldrums during February. Winter's been going on long enough to be boring, and spring is still too far off to seem real. But that day at school, I'd had a conversation that cheered me right up.",

I was sitting in the cafeteria, eating with Mary Anne Spier, my best friend since forever, when her steady boyfriend Logan Bruno walked up and plopped down his tray. I was just about to comment on how much his chicken chow mein looked like dog barf (a comment Mary Anne wouldn't have appreciated at all, even though it was true), when Logan said something that totally distracted me.\n\n\"Pitchers and catchers report in two weeks!\"\n\n\"Two weeks?\" I said. \"All right!\" I made a fist and pumped my arm.\n\n\"Report?\" asked Mary Anne. \"On what? Their activities since the last baseball season? Is that like when our teachers used to make us write those \\\"What I Did on My Summer Vacation\\\" essays?\" She giggled.\n\nLogan and I just stared at her for a second, and then we burst out laughing. Mary Anne's giggles faded abruptly and a hurt look flashed across her face. Right away, I felt terrible for laughing at her. Mary Anne is extremely sensitive. Knowing her, I had the feeling she might start crying in another second. Right in the middle of the cafeteria.\n\nI rushed to set her straight. \"It's not report like a written report,\" I said. \"It's report like report for duty. It means they have to show up for spring training in two weeks.\" I turned to Logan and grinned. \"Two weeks!\" I said. I held up my hand for a high five and he smacked it.\n\n\"That's great,\" said Mary Anne. \"I mean, I guess it's great.\"\n\nShe paused. \"Um, why is it great?\" she asked tentatively.\n\nThis time we were careful not to laugh at her. \"Because,\" explained Logan, \"it means spring \u2014 and baseball \u2014 will be here soon.\"",

Bedford Zoo to host animal world VIPs.\" I held up the front page of the newspaper, which displayed a large color photo. \"James and Mojo.\"\n\n\"Mojo?\" a voice from the kitchen door repeated. \"What kind of a name is that?\"\n\nI giggled. \"It's a name for a gorilla.\" I turned the newspaper so Dawn could see. \"Here's her picture. Isn't she darling?\"\n\n\"Mary Anne, you think every fuzzy\u2011faced, four\u2011legged creature is darling,\" Dawn said.\n\nI thought about it \u2014 but not for long. \"I guess I do.\" As if to prove it, I picked up my extremely cute gray\u2011striped kitten off the floor and plopped him in my lap. \"Isn't that right, Tigger?\"\n\nTigger's motor started instantly. I scratched him in one of his favorite spots, between the ears, and smiled as his eyelids dropped to halfmast.\n\nSince you've already met Tigger and Dawn, I guess I should introduce myself. I'm Mary Anne Spier. I'm thirteen years old, and I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, with my dad, my stepmother Sharon, and my stepsister, Dawn (and Tigger).\n\nYou'll notice I said stepmother and stepsister. That's because this is my dad's second marriage. He didn't get divorced, like a lot of parents I know. My mother died when I was a baby, so I have no memories of her. We have photos of her, so I know what she looked like, but it's not quite the same as remembering.\n\nFor the longest time, it was just me and my father. Because he had to raise me all by himself, Dad used to be really strict. I'm not kidding. For one thing, I couldn't talk on the phone, except to ask questions about homework. But the worst thing was the way he made me dress. Can you imagine a seventh\u2011grader wearing pigtails and jumpers with kneesocks? It was terrible. I felt like a baby.\n\nTo make matters worse, I was \u2014 and still am \u2014 extremely shy. It was difficult for me to make friends. It was also hard for me to stand up to my father. When I finally did, it really changed my life.",

We had tons of fun laughing at all of the strange hairdos and funny outfits that they wore twenty years ago. Then we saw a message he had written to S.E.P. under his picture. S.E.P. were Dawn\u2019s mother\u2019s initials before she got married! We flipped to Sharon\u2019s picture. It said \"Dearest Richie\" with a really gushy message signed \"Always and forever, Sharon.\"\n\nRichie was my dad. He and Sharon had been high school sweethearts. Isn\u2019t that incredible?

It's a charm bracelet, just like the ones most people wear on their wrists. I like to be a little different, so I wear mine on my ankle.\n\nAt the moment, that ankle was dangling over a foot of cool water. I was sitting on the ground, leaning back on my elbows, with both feet hanging over the edge of Jamie Newton's Lion King wading pool.\n\nNo, Jamie isn't my boyfriend. (I actually don't have a boyfriend at the moment. Know any cool, single guys?) He's cute, but he's way, way too young for me. Jamie's only four years old. That wading pool, while it looks the size of a puddle to me, must seem like a full-size Olympic pool to him. He was splashing happily in it, stopping every few seconds to hitch up his red-and-blue-striped bathing suit, which threatened to fall down around his ankles every time he moved.\n\nI was baby-sitting for Jamie while his mom took his baby sister Lucy to the pediatrician. He'd been in the pool ever since she left, and I was glad to hang out and watch him, even though it meant being splashed every few minutes. Those sprays of water felt great, because it was hot outside. That's right, hot. Not just warm. Not just hot. HOT! It was midsummer, and it was the kind of day when you work up a sweat just sitting still. So I felt happy to be hanging out under the big maple tree in the Newtons' front yard, with my feet over the pool and a white baseball cap pulled down low over my eyes.",

          "text": "\"I guess it's about time for me to tell you who I am. My name is Claudia Kishi, I'm thirteen years old, and my charm bracelet is my life. No, seriously. I've chosen the charms carefully to represent different parts of my personality. You can learn a lot about me by studying each charm in turn.\n\nFor example, the little crayon symbolizes my love for art of all kinds. I love creating art, looking at it, learning about it, and even just thinking about it. Art is a major part of my life.\n\nThe bird that Jamie was looking at is a silver crane, which represents my Japanese heritage. In Japan, the crane is a symbol of peace. I'm Japanese-American: both of my parents are, too. You'd know it if you looked at me, since I have dark, almond-shaped eyes and long, straight, shiny black hair. I look almost exactly like my grandmother Mimi did when she was my age. She came to this country from Japan when she was thirty-two years old. Mimi lived with my family until she died not long ago, and I was very close to her. Looking at the little crane on my charm bracelet always reminds me of her, and makes me feel proud of my ancestry.\n\nThe Hershey's Kiss stands for my devotion to junk food. But that devotion is by no means limited to chocolate. No, I make it a point to eat a balanced junk-food diet, choosing each day from the four official junk-food groups: candy, chips, cookies, and soda. My parents don't approve (they believe in those other, totally boring food groups: dairy, meat, grains, and vegetables), so I keep my addiction a secret.\n\nThe book charm reveals another of my secrets: I adore Nancy Drew mysteries. My parents would prefer that I read the literary equivalent of the four food groups, so the Nancy Drews are currently hidden in my sock drawer along with the Snickers bars and Fritos. I'm pretty good about not reading them when I should be doing other things, such as homework.\n\nI go to Stoneybrook Middle School \u2014 when school's in session, that is. School is my favorite thing in the whole world. Not! Truthfully, school is something I could probably live without pretty easily, except for the fact that I'd miss my friends. Well, I'd miss art class, too, I guess. But, that day by Jamie's pool, even though I was starting to feel the tiniest bit bored with the long, hot days of summer, I definitely wasn't eager for school to start again.\n\nMy older sister Janine, on the other hand, is one of those kids who can't get enough school. She's a junior in high school, but she also takes college classes. (She's a genius, so she can handle it.) I've actually seen her act all mopey on the last day of school, because she hates to \"bid the academic year farewell,\" as she once put it. Not that summer makes much of a difference in her routine. To Janine, free time is just time to fill up with classes and seminars and reading and studying. Her boyfriend Jerry practically has to beg her to take time off for picnics and hikes.\n\nMy parents, naturally, are very proud of Janine. But you know what? Even though they have to nag me about doing my homework on time, they're proud of me, too. They're supportive, they're enthusiastic about my art, and they're impressed by the fact that I've been earning all my own spending money for a long time now.\n\nI do that by baby-sitting, which is one of my other loves. (Maybe I should buy a little baby rattle or something to add to my charm bracelet.) I belong to a club \u2014 well, really, it's more like a business \u2014 called the Baby-sitters Club, or BSC. All of us in the club love kids and love taking care of them, which is why our club has been so successful.\n\n\"Look, Claudee!\"",

Then, suddenly, he frowned. \"I'm tired of swimming,\" he announced.\n\nKids' moods change so suddenly sometimes.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said agreeably. \"Why don't you hop out so I can dry you off? Then we'll think of something else to do.\"\n\nJamie climbed out of the pool and let me wrap him up in a soft, fresh-smelling blue towel. He squirmed like a puppy while I dried his hair, and I couldn't resist giving him a little squeeze.\n\nOnce Jamie was dry, I emptied out the pool and left it upside-down",

          "text": "\"Stacey?\"\n\n\"Here!\" I called out. Then I continued to draw suns, planets, stars, and hearts on the front cover of my social studies notebook. It was a bright, sunny fall morning, and I was sitting in creative doodling class, otherwise known as homeroom.\n\nHomeroom. What a strange name. It's a room, all right, but it's nothing like home. Unless your home happens to have chalkboards, fluorescent lights, and seven rows of barely awake eighth\u2011graders who are whispering, passing notes, brushing their hair, or scrambling to finish the last three questions of their math homework, while a teacher (Ms. Levine, in my case) tries to take attendance, keep some order, and make announcements.\n\nI don't know about you, but, thankfully, my home isn't anything like that. For one thing, my mom hardly ever takes attendance. (Just kidding.)\n\nI mostly use homeroom as a time to gather myself together for the day. None of my good friends is in my homeroom, so I don't have anybody to whisper with or pass notes to. (Sheila McGregor and I used to pass notes back and forth, but we don't anymore, which is a long story I'll tell to you some other time.) I always take care of my hair and clothes before I leave the house in the morning, since both of those things are pretty important to me, so I'm never brushing my hair or checking my outfit in the classroom. And I never leave my math homework unfinished. English homework, maybe, but never math. I actually like math, and I'm good at it, so I usually breeze right through any assignments.\n\nI always sit next to Sheila McGregor in homeroom. Why? Because my name is Stacey McGill, which means Sheila and I are alphabetically related. Like Sheila, I'm thirteen, and I go to SMS \u2014 Stoneybrook Middle School \u2014 which is in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. Unlike Sheila, and unlike most of my classmates, I did not grow up in Stoneybrook. I grew up in New York City, in Manhattan. (My parents are divorced, and my dad still lives in New York. Even though I chose to live in Stoneybrook with my mom, I still visit him there as often as I can.) And, not to be a snob about it, my urban roots do set me apart a little from the rest of the SMS student body. It's not that I'm better than them, it's just that I've seen more (including sad things, such as homeless people, and terrific things, such as the Caribbean Day parade) and done more (not too many kids in my class can say they've been to the opera, or to an exhibit of French avant\u2011garde painters) than a lot of Connecticut kids my age.",

My body doesn't make this stuff called insulin, which is necessary for processing sugars and carbohydrates. That means two things: one, I have to give myself insulin to make up for the fact that I don't produce it myself (I inject it, which isn't nearly as big a deal as you'd think), and two, I have to keep a very close eye on my blood sugar, which I do by testing my blood regularly and by being extremely careful about what I eat. I have to keep track of every bit of food I consume, every day. And sweets are pretty much out. When we first found out I had diabetes, my parents were incredibly overprotective, especially since I'm an only child. They've eased off a bit, because I've taken more and more responsibility for caring for myself. By now, it's almost routine. But even so, diabetes is a major part of my life.\n\nIt's only a part, though. I don't see myself as a sick person at all. I can do anything my friends can do (except pig out on chocolate bars), and I try never to let my diabetes bother me. And, while I'm definitely not glad I have diabetes, I think dealing with it has helped me grow up a bit faster than some of my classmates.",

That morning in homeroom, he was trying his hardest to drive Ms. Levine nuts by clicking his ballpoint pen about seventy zillion times a minute. Every time she looked up to see where the sound was coming from, he'd stop and give her this innocent smile. Then, when she looked down at her attendance sheet again, his smile would turn into a devilish grin and he'd start clicking again. Ms. Levine finally decided to ignore the noise, which was the smartest thing for her to do.\n\nI ignored him, too. I blocked out that irritating clicking noise by humming my current favorite song, \"Sister Sally\" (by the group Great Blue Whales) as I doodled on my notebook. By then I was drawing linked hearts with the caption S. M. + R. B. = LUV. My boyfriend's name is Robert Brewster, and I really do luv him. In fact, he's the most luvable guy I've ever met. I drew a string of hearts across the top of the back of my notebook, and I was trying to decide if I should keep going and cover the whole notebook with them when suddenly a storm of static erupted from the loudspeaker over the classroom door.",

I have never heard one announcement at SMS that didn't start with an earsplitting burst of static. It usually doesn't last long, though, and it didn't that morning. Soon, I could hear a voice through the noise. It was Mr. Kingbridge, our assistant principal. Mr. Kingbridge is okay, except for the fact that he has no fashion sense. I mean none. He wears the most ridiculous ties, the silliest jackets, and the ugliest shoes I've ever seen. At an awards night one year, he won the prize for worst dressed.

          "text": "\"I'm sorry. I really am. It breaks my heart. But we have to face reality. I love you, but I just can't go out with you,\" I said.\n\nI giggled until I began laughing. Then I leaned back against the wall and sighed.\n\nI bet you're wondering what the guy thought.\n\nWell, there was no guy. The speech I'd made was directed to a pair of skis.\n\n\"You've really gone around the bend this time, Abigail Stevenson,\" I told myself. I shook my head. It's one thing to talk to yourself, but talking to sporting goods is really pushing it. And the thing was, it hadn't just been the skis. I'd been standing in front of the hall closet Mom lets me use for all my sports equipment, chatting with my ice skates, my baseball glove, my running shoes, and even my tennis racket.\n\nMaybe I should explain. It's February. Doesn't that make everything clear?\n\nWell, for me it does. February is my least favorite month of the year. February is just so \u2014 Februaryish. It has absolutely nothing going for it, unless you're a big fan of Valentine's Day, or of Washington's Birthday sales. I couldn't care less about either. But one thing I do care about is being active. I love to be outside, working up a sweat. I play soccer in the fall, and softball in the summer. I bike, I run, I ski, I play tennis. Sports aren't my whole life; I have plenty of other interests. But in February, I miss sports most of all. It's always gloomy and gray in February, and it's too cold for some things (such as running, or tennis), and often too warm for others (such as skiing).\n\nThe only good thing about February, for me, is that there isn't much pollen floating around in the air. Pollen is The Enemy, as far as my respiratory system is concerned. I am outrageously allergic to the stuff. I have other enemies, too, such as animal hair and dust, but pollen is the worst because it's everywhere and you can't avoid it. So, as long as my asthma doesn't kick in, I usually breathe easily during February. But besides that, the month is basically useless.\n\nSo that's why I told my tennis racket that it would have to wait for me, and my softball glove that I adored it but that it didn't make sense for us to be together just then. I'd vowed to go out with my skates \"someday\" (if the pond ever froze over again), and promised my running shoes a date in the near future.\n\nFortunately nobody observed me playing out these crazy little love scenes. This was one time I was thankful to be home alone. I'm home alone a lot of the time. That's because my family consists of just me and two other people: my twin sister, Anna, and our mom.\n\nThe three of us moved into this house not long ago, after my mom was given a big promotion at work. We used to live in a nice house on Long Island (that's in New York), but when Mom was promoted she decided we could afford to move to an even nicer, bigger house in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. Mom commutes to work in New York City, which is an hour-long train ride away. I didn't mind the move much. I think it's fun to shake things up and bring change into your life.\n\nGood change, that is. Not horrible, sudden, painful change. I know about that kind of change, too. I went through it four years ago when my dad died in a car wreck. That changed our family forever, and \u2014\n\nAnd I really don't want to talk about it. It still hurts too much. I'd rather tell you more about my family and me. First of all, Anna and I are identical twins. We're both thirteen, but Anna is about eight minutes older than me; she was born first. She loves to remind me to respect my \"elders.\" We have brown eyes (nearsighted ones \u2014 we both wear contacts and glasses interchangeably), set into sort of pointy faces. And while we do look a lot alike, nobody has trouble telling us apart. Partly that's because I wear my dark, curly hair long and Anna wears hers short.\n\nBut partly it's because we're so different. Anna would never talk to a closetful of athletic equipment. A closetful of musical instruments, maybe. I can't imagine what you could say to a violin, but Anna would know. Anna is Miss Violin. She knows everything about the instrument, since she's been playing it practically forever. Music is her life. Most of her friends are from orchestras or other groups she plays in. She takes private lessons and practices for hours every day. She's really good, I guess. I wouldn't know for sure, since as far as musical taste goes, I'm more into Motown than Mozart.\n\nSo Anna's dedicated to her music, and my mom's dedicated to her job. (She's a real workaholic, especially since my dad died.) And me? I'm dedicated to having fun. I like things to happen, and if that means I have to make them happen, well, that's okay by me. I like to meet people and go places and do things, and I hate \u2014 absolutely hate \u2014 to be bored.\n\nAnd that afternoon, I was definitely bored. In fact, I was so bored that I actually (gasp!) decided to head up to my room and start on my math homework. (I usually scramble through my math homework during homeroom. Procrastination is my middle name.) After one last, lingering glance at my skis, I closed the closet door and trudged up the stairs.\n\nI'd barely made it through Problem 4A (out of twenty-five) when I heard the front door open and close. I flew down the stairs. \"Anna! You're home!\" I cried, flinging my arms around my sister.\n\nAnna took a surprised step backward and raised her eyebrows at me. We are not normally a demonstrative family. \"Hello, Abby,\" she said, putting down her violin case as she unbuttoned her coat.\n\n\"I am so glad to see you,\" I said.\n\n\"I noticed,\" she replied. \"And I wondered why. Do I owe you money or something?\"\n\n\"No, of course not. It's just that I've been so bored, and now that you're home we can do something together. Like ... like,\" I paused to think, and then I snapped my fingers. \"Like make a terrific dinner, to surprise Mom. She promised to be home early tonight, but I bet she's planning on ordering pizza or something.\"\n\nI was babbling away so fast that",

I'm thirteen and in the eighth grade at SMS (Stoneybrook Middle School), which is in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, the town where I've spent almost my whole life. I say almost because for a short time, when I was just a baby, I lived in Maynard, Iowa, with my grandparents. That was right after my mother died. At the time, my father was too overcome with grief to take care of me, so he sent me to stay with my mother's parents. They loved having me. In fact, they loved me so much that they wanted to keep me with them forever. If my father hadn't fought for me, I might be attending MMS (Maynard Middle School), and saying good-bye to my pet hog Wilbur instead of to Tigger. And I certainly never would have met Dawn.",

Dawn's mom had grown up in Stoneybrook (just like my dad), but had moved to California, married, and had Dawn and Jeff. But that marriage wasn't meant to last. After the divorce, she brought her children back to Connecticut. When Dawn and I met, we became instant friends, which was a little unusual for me, since I'm normally very shy. She even joined this club I belong to, the Baby-sitters Club, or BSC (more about that later). Then, one day, when we were looking through some old yearbooks, we discovered that my dad (Richard) and her mom (Sharon) had dated each other when they were in high school, but had sadly part",

(He was also trying to prove to my grandparents that he could handle the job of raising me.) He used to make me wear little-girl clothes, for example, and keep my room decorated in little-girl style. To be honest, my dad was coming around even before he met Sharon (I'd begun to convince him that I was a responsible young woman), but now he's really loosened up. Although \"loose\" is a relative term in my father's case. He's still the neatest, most organized person I know \u2014 next to me. (We both arrange our closets according to season and our sock drawers according to color, for example.) Sharon, by the way, is his (our) total opposite: She's a bit of a flake when it comes to sticking to schedules or keeping things tidy. (She's been known to save balancing the checkbook for a \"rainy day\" \u2014 which never comes \u2014 and has more than once forgotten to put away groceries until the ice cream becomes soup.)",

Here's the story: First of all, even before Sharon and my dad married, Jeff (Dawn's brother) had realized that he would never enjoy living in Connecticut. He missed his dad and he missed California, so the only solution was for him to move back out there. Naturally, Dawn missed him and her dad like crazy, which meant that she ended up being bicoastal for a while. (That's just a fancy way of saying that she spent a lot of time in the air, flying between the East and West Coasts.) After awhile her visits west lasted longer and longer, and finally, she decided California was her real home, and she moved there permanently. She still visits here, of course, but I doubt she'll ever live in Connecticut again.",

          "text": "June had not come too soon. (If I were a poet, I'd add something about the moon here, too, right?)\n\nBut a poet I'm not. The president of a small business, yes. A thirteen-year-old eighth-grader at Stoneybrook Middle School, yes. A major sports fan, true. The coach of a softball team for kids, also true. Not a poet, though. And there was no moon, yet. At least, not much of one. It was the first weekend in June, and the full moon was a couple of weeks away.\n\nBut maybe the moon did have something to do with the events that followed. A long time ago, some people believed that the full moon could make you crazy.\n\nOf course that's not true. But some pretty unusual things did happen at SMS, all in the time that the moon was getting fuller and fuller....\n\nOn that Sunday afternoon of the first weekend in June, though, I wasn't thinking about the moon or poetry. What was I thinking about? Final exams, and summer. It was time to make plans. Time to get organized. Summer was almost here, and I didn't want to be caught unprepared.\n\nI'm a very organized person. Anyone who wanted to describe me, Kristy Thomas, would say, \"She is organized. To the max.\" I consider this a compliment. I don't even mind being described as bossy, which is another adjective that's often applied to me. I like being in charge. That way, I'm sure everything gets done, and done the right way the first time. (In case you can't tell, I have very strong opinions about how things should be done \u2014 and organized!)\n\nI also think that being bossy makes people forget that I am the shortest person in the eighth grade at SMS. Being short doesn't bother me (except that, sportswise, it doesn't hurt to be on the taller side) but my parents and my two older brothers are not short, so I figure I'll grow. Meanwhile, since I'm outspoken and occasionally loud, people don't make the mistake of overlooking me.\n\nMy family is larger than your average family. I'm not talking about height or weight, I'm talking about numbers. I've always been in a larger-than-average family. My father walked out on us when my younger brother, David Michael (who is seven), was just a baby. That left my mother, David Michael, me, and my two older brothers Sam and Charlie (who are fifteen and seventeen now) in what you might politely call a rough spot. (Only I don't feel very polite when I think about it.) We lived in a little house on Bradford Court. Although times were hard, we became very close as a family. I really admire the way my mom hung in there, working hard, telling us the truth but preventing us from worrying. We all did our share to help keep things going smoothly. Gradually our situation improved.\n\nThen Mom met Watson Brewer. And fell in love. And got married.\n\nWe moved to a mansion.\n\nAmazing true story, right? Watson is a real live millionaire. So now we live in a huge place with a separate room for each of us, plus rooms for Watson's two kids, Andrew (age four) and Karen (age seven) from his first marriage (they stay with us during alternate months); our adopted sister Emily Michelle, a toddler who was born in Vietnam; and our maternal grandmother, Nannie, who came to help out after Emily Michelle arrived. Then there are our Bernese mountain dog puppy, Shannon; our cranky cat, Boo-Boo; and assorted other pets (including goldfish and hamsters). There's even a ghost who has his own room on the third floor.\n\nOkay, maybe not a ghost. Karen believes that the spirit of one of her ancestors, Ben Brewer, lives up there. But then, Karen has a very vivid imagination.\n\nSee? Big house, big family, big potential for disorganization and chaos if you're not willing to Speak Up and See That Things Get Done.",

I would take my books out there, do some studying, and make plans. I found the hammock and lugged it outside.\n\nNannie and Watson, who are both gardening fanatics, were already out back. They were surveying the impatiens, which filled a whole flowerbed in one corner. Nannie had on a big hat, and overalls that were liberally smeared with dirt and grass stains, especially around the knees. A pair of gardening gloves stuck out of one pocket. She was holding a gardening catalog open and pointing to something on the page.\n\nWatson, standing next to her, looked thoughtful. He wore a big hat, too, and ancient khakis that were decorated in \"early garden,\" just like Nannie's overalls. He was wearing his gloves, and he was leaning against a pitchfork.\n\nEmily Michelle, in a flowered sunbonnet and a tiny pair of Oshkosh overalls, was squatting by a patch of dirt, digging holes with the help of Shannon the puppy. This was, I knew, Emily Michelle's garden. She dug lots of holes in it, and pulled up everything that actually manages to grow there. Everyone has a different idea of what a garden should look like, I guess.\n\nIncluding Watson and Nannie. Nannie lifted her hand and pointed to another flowerbed, still buried under straw from the winter. Watson didn't seem to agree with whatever she'd said. He turned a page of the catalog, nodded at it, and gestured toward the same patch of straw. Now it was Nannie's turn to look thoughtful.\n\nSerious botanical decision taking place, I realized.\n\nI grinned. They didn't even notice me.",

My mom grew up in Stoneybrook, so it made sense for her to bring me and my younger brother, Jeff, (he's ten) back here to live after she and my dad split up. It was wonderful to make a friend here right away, especially a friend who invited me to join the best club in the world: the Baby\u2011sitters Club, or BSC.

          "text": "\"Back to my history with Mary Anne: As I said, before we became sisters, we were friends. One of the first things I learned about Mary Anne was that she was an only child, and that her mother had died when Mary Anne was just a baby. Mary Anne's dad had brought her up on his own, except for a brief time when she lived with her grandparents, her mother's parents. Mr. Spier took his job as a single father very seriously. In fact, Mary Anne was parented so well and so completely that she was barely allowed to grow up!\n\nEventually, her dad began to see that forcing Mary Anne to wear her hair in braids and dress in jumpers wouldn't keep her eight years old forever. He started to understand that she was a teenager, and that she needed to have her own responsibilities and to make her own decisions. Finally, Mary Anne was allowed to choose her own clothes, and to decorate her room the way she wanted to. She also acquired a kitten (an adorable gray tiger cat named Tigger) and a steady boyfriend (an adorable ex\u2011Southerner named Logan Bruno).\n\nMeanwhile, Mary Anne and I were becoming closer and closer. Then, one day, when we were leafing through an old yearbook of her father's, we discovered something awesome. My mom and her dad had been high school sweethearts!\n\nWell, it didn't take too long for us to hatch a plan for hooking them up again, and the cool thing is that the plan worked. It worked so well, in fact, that soon we were hearing wedding bells. After the wedding, Mary Anne and her dad, Richard, moved in with me and my mom, Sharon. (By that time my brother, Jeff, had realized that he'd never truly be at home on the East Coast, and he'd gone back to California to live with our dad.) It took us a while to settle in to being a family, but eventually we were very happy together, here in this old Connecticut farmhouse. (A farmhouse, I might add, that actually has a secret passage and its very own ghost!)\"",

The short visits became longer ones, and, like Jeff, I began to feel more and more convinced that California was where I really belonged. My roots are there, I guess. And friends such as Sunny Winslow who knew me when I didn't have any front teeth. Sunny's like a sister to me, so when I found out recently that her mom has cancer, I knew Sunny would need me nearby.\n\nI ended up deciding that I wanted to make California my primary home, and I moved back to Palo City. I still come to Stoneybrook for holidays, though. Plus, Jeff and I spent the whole summer here, which has been terrific. Jeff headed back early, and I'll follow him out to California in a few weeks.

I even impressed myself.\n\nI closed the front door behind me and waited for the reaction.\n\nMy friend Abby Stevenson and I had been working on a routine from an I Love Lucy rerun. We'd just been baby-sitting for the seven Barrett/DeWitt kids that afternoon, and we'd had them in hysterics.\n\nI could hear my parents upstairs. (Lucky me. My mom is sometimes back from work at five o'clock on Fridays, but Dad only rarely makes it home early.) Their voices were muffled, so I figured they were in their bedroom.\n\nTime for the Ricky laugh. I closed up my throat and made a sound like a seal's bark: \"HA! HA! HA! HA!\" You would have thought Desi Arnaz was there in the Kishi living room.\n\nClick. I heard my parents' door open. \"Hello, Claudia Lynn,\" my mom called out.\n\nMy older sister, Janine, appeared at the top of the stairs, wearing headphones. \"Did you bring a dog home?\" she asked.\n\n\"Nope,\" I said. \"It's just me. Can you tell who I was imitat \u2014?\"\n\n\"Then will you please stop yapping?\" Janine barged on. \"I'm listening to my astrophysics lecture.\"\n\nUh-huh. Right.\n\nHow many kids do you know with high-school-age sisters who take astrophysics? I'll bet you can count them on the fingers of one elbow.\n\nIt's not easy living with a genius. My sister takes courses at a local college, for fun. I happen to think her idea of fun is seriously twisted.\n\nNow, I love Janine dearly, but we do not have a lot in common. For one thing, when teachers see her IQ score, they go weak in the knees.\n\nActually, they go weak in the knees when they see mine, too. But for a different reason.\n\nI wouldn't know astrophysics from AstroTurf. And I couldn't begin to spell either one of them. Mention history and I start to droop. I used to think algebra was a type of lingerie.",

Actually, you could tell a lot about me from the way I looked that day: I was wearing a white high-collared dentist's shirt and a loose-fitting Chinese silk jacket, cinched at the waist by a bright-orange scarf, over tight black flared pants. My hair was gathered on top of my head with an orange bandanna.\n\nI know, you think I'm demented. But trust me, it looked great. Anyone can copy an outfit from a model in Seventeen, but it takes talent to make a funky cool outfit out of stuff from thrift stores and yard sales.\n\nThat's how I look at life \u2014 creating something wild and beautiful from unexpected sources.\n\nMaybe that's why I don't do well in school. In math, for instance, I love to make interesting shapes out of the numbers and symbols. I kind of lose track of the problem. I'm much happier in front of an easel or a lump of clay or a box full of beads and string. Art is my number one passion. Painting, sculpting, drawing, jewelry making \u2014 I love them all.\n\nMy other main passion is eating. Not just any food, though. It has to be absolutely horrible for your health. If sugar were flammable, my bedroom would be a major fire hazard. My parents forbid unhealthy eating, so I hide candy bars in my socks, bags of pretzels in my shoe boxes, cookies among my art supplies. (I also hide Nancy Drew books, because Mom and Dad think I should read only textbooks and Serious Literature.)\n\nBelieve it or not, I did once have a real soulmate in the Kishi family \u2014 my grandmother, Mimi. She really understood me. I've missed her terribly since she died, and I keep her picture on my bedroom wall for inspiration.\n\nMimi would have cracked up at my Ricky imitation.\n\nOh, well.",

Flinging my backpack onto the bed, I reached into my night table drawer and took out a fresh, unopened box of Yodels.\n\nMy clock read 5:10. In twenty minutes, my friends from the Baby-sitters Club would be coming over for a meeting (more about them later). I had just enough time to relax, eat, and do some homework. (Well, think about doing some homework, anyway.)\n\n\"Can't they take a suite in a hotel?\" my mother's voice filtered in from down the hall.\n\n\"I couldn't very well ask them that, Rioko,\" my dad said. \"Maybe they can't afford the rates. The point is, they're our friends, and they need a place to stay. Why are you so resistant?\"\n\n\"I just don't think it's prudent, John.\"\n\nI started giggling. I don't know why. I guess because \"prudent\" reminded me of \"prunes.\" Anyway, I nearly choked on my Yodel.\n\n\"Prudent?\" my dad repeated. \"You're worried about what the people in town will think of us?\"\n\n\"No, I meant on their part, John. I wonder if it's wise of them to come back to Stoneybrook. People still remember what happened at the lighthouse.\"\n\n\"Oh, come now. You and I know Alex didn't do anything wrong.\"\n\nI stopped coughing.\n\nWhat were they talking about?\n\nThe lighthouse? The old, graffiti-covered Stoneybrook lighthouse?\n\nHow weird. If Stoneybrook had a Most Ignored Building award, it would definitely go to that lighthouse. I guess boats used it in ancient times, but it had been boarded up for as long as I could remember. Kids say it's haunted, which I don't believe, of course. But the place definitely looks creepy, standing at the edge of an old jetty in the Sound, surrounded by a razor-wire fence.\n\nKnowing my dad, whatever \"happened\" at the lighthous",

You're only eighteen, yet you command the entire New York fashion industry.\n\nI put the hairbrush into my other hand, turned so that I was facing in the other direction, and pretended to answer the interviewer's question, using a more grown-up, sophisticated version of my own voice. \"Well, Bob, it all started back when I was thirteen and in eighth grade. I was living in the quaint little town of Stoneybrook, Connecticut, at the time. Have you heard of it?\" I tossed my hair back and smiled. Of course Bob had heard of it. Now that I was so famous, everyone had heard of Stoneybrook.\n\nI switched the hairbrush again. \"That's where you spent your teen years, isn't it?\" I asked in Bob's voice.\n\n\"That's right,\" I answered, switching hairbrush and voice once more. \"And I'll never forget the wonderful friends I had \u2014\"\n\n\"Stacey!\" That was my mother's voice, and she sounded cross. She was calling me from downstairs.\n\nOops. Back to Reality Land.",

Let's move it, okay?\"\n\n\"Be right down!\" I said. It was time to hustle. The interview was over, and so was my fantasy. Instead of the most powerful woman in fashion, I was a thirteen-year-old middle school student. Oh, well. It had been fun to dream. And I knew my mom wouldn't be too mad if she knew what I'd been up to. After all, that's what today was all about: career dreams and how you really can make them come true.\n\nIt was Take Our Daughters to Work Day, the day every April when parents all across the country bring their young daughters to work with them so the girls see that they can be anything they want to be. The day lets girls find out what certain jobs are really like, and try them on for size. All of my friends \u2014 the ones I had started to tell \"Bob\" about \u2014 would be taking part. I was psyched about going to work with my mom, who is a buyer at Stoneybrook's biggest (actually, Stoneybrook's only) department store: Bellair's.\n\nI've loved fashion for as long as I can remember. When I was in kindergarten and the other kids were drawing houses and dogs, I was drawing dresses and shoes. In first grade, I passed over Highlights and looked at my mother's Vogue magazines instead. By third grade, I was in charge of costumes for our school play.\n\nI grew up in Manhattan, and I always preferred Macy's to the zoo, Bloomingdale's to the circus. Early on, I became a knowledgeable and talented shopper. I could \u2014 and still can \u2014 sniff out a bargain anywhere. I have an eye for what's trendy and what's classic. (I love both looks. Classics are great for building a wardrobe, and trendy clothes are just plain fun.)\n\nSomeday I'd like to be a designer, or maybe the editor of a fashion magazine, or even the owner of some major fashion-oriented business. (I have a head for figures. Math is my best subject.) But I hope I'll always have a life, too. I mean, I like other things besides fashion. For example, I love kids, which is why I'm a member of the BSC, or Baby-sitters Club (more about that later). And I never want to be a workaholic like my dad. He just doesn't know when to quit, which is a big part of the reason that he and my mom are divorced. (He still lives in Manhattan, and I visit him as often as I can.)\n\nAnyway, as you can imagine, I was looking forward to my day at Bellair's. My mom and I have been very close, especially since the divorce. I'm an only child, so it's just the two of us now. I actually like spending time with my mom, which I know is fairly unusual for a thirteen-year-old. (That's not to say that she doesn't embarrass me occasionally, or that we never fight.) And, while I have a pretty good idea of what my mom does at work, I've never spent a big block of time watching her in action. And today I was not only going to watch, but I'd be helping out. I had a feeling it was going to be an interesting day.\n\nI checked myself one more time in the mirror. I'd dressed extra carefully, in a white linen blouse, a navy skirt, and heels. I wanted to look mature and a little sophisticated, so I'd skipped the fun hair accessories I sometimes wear to school, and put my curly (permed) blonde hair up in a simple twist. A dab of pink lip gloss, a quick sweep of mascara (it brings out my blue eyes), and I was ready.",

I guess she'd forgiven me for being such a slowpoke.\n\n'Thanks,' I answered. 'You do, too.' I rummaged around in the cereal cabinet, looking for the Grape Nuts. Then I sat down with a bowl of cereal, a glass of orange juice, and a banana. Nice, balanced breakfast, right? You bet. Sometimes I'd just like to grab a doughnut, or even skip breakfast altogether, the way some of my friends do. But I can't. I have diabetes, which means that my body doesn't process sugars and carbohydrates correctly. If I don't watch what I eat, I can become extremely sick.\n\nI also have to check my blood sugar regularly. I'd already done so that morning, up in my room. I have to prick my finger for a drop of blood, put it on a test strip, and check the reading my little electronic monitor gives me. The number I see there tells me how I'm doing and helps me determine how much insulin I need to take. Insulin is a hormone that my body doesn't produce the way it should, so I have to give myself shots of it every day. Sounds gross, I know. I don't like it, but I don't have any choice in the matter, so I try to make the best of it.\n\nJust as I wolfed down the last bite of cereal, my mom gla",

She paused, thought for a moment, and added, \"And I don't want to be hit, either.\"\n\n\"You're not going to be,\" I assured her quickly. Claire has been known to throw a wicked temper tantrum. \"Neither is Linny. Or Nicky. Or anyone.\"\n\nThe subject was baseball \u2014 baseball and books. Linny, who's nine, had been reading baseball books. In one of the books, he'd read about a ballplayer who used to step in front of pitches. When the pitch hit him, he'd be awarded an automatic walk to first base.\n\nNeedless to say, this was not a strategy I wanted to practice in our league.\n\nWhat league is that? Well, I guess you could say we are in a league of our own. I'm the coach of Kristy's Krushers, a softball team made up of kids ranging from two to nine years old, with an average age of 5.83. The skill level of our team is as broad as the age spread. We play for fun, but that doesn't mean that we don't take our fun seriously. At the moment, however, Linny was taking it just a little too seriously, in my opinion. And I could tell by the stubborn look in his eye that he wasn't going to give up easily.\n\nAbby Stevenson, my neighbor, fellow Baby-sitters Club member (more about that in a little while), and the assistant coach of the team, said, \"Good thinking, though, Linny. You really did your homework.\"\n\nHer praise did not placate Linny. He stuck out his lower lip almost as far as Claire's and scowled.\n\nIt was a beautiful day in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. School was out, and summer had begun. What better way to start a summer, I had reasoned, than by doing a little of the old ballpark shuffle, bopping to some baseline boogie-woogie, taking myself out to a ballgame. So I had called a Krushers softball practice.\n\n\"Why don't we work on a little baserunning,\" I said. We could stand to improve our base-running, and it was a good way to help the kids use up some excess energy. And maybe prevent a fight.\n\nJackie Rodowsky, all heart and a pretty good softball player (in spite of the fact that he has more than earned the affectionate nickname \"the Walking Disaster\"), said, \"Yeah! Baserunning!\"\n\nSeveral other kids added enthusiastic agreement to my suggestion \u2014 but Linny remained stubbornly silent.\n\nI decided that once he started baserunning, he'd come around. \"Linny, you run first,\" I said, grabbing the bat. \"Now, who wants to field the balls?\"",

I guess I'd better go back to the beginning and give you a play\u2011by\u2011play.\n\nI'm Kristy \u2014 Kristy Thomas. I'm thirteen years old and I'm in the eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. In addition to being the coach of the Krushers, I'm also president and founder of the Baby\u2011sitters Club (keep reading for more info on that), as well as the oldest daughter in a very large blended family. In fact, I almost have enough people in my family to field an entire baseball team.\n\nKaren, at shortstop, is my stepfather's daughter. She's seven. Her younger brother (my stepbrother), Andrew, who is four, is also a Krusher, as is my younger brother, David Michael. He's seven, too. Family members who are not on the team include my mother; my stepfather, Watson Brewer; my maternal grandmother, Nannie; my two older brothers, Charlie and Sam; my younger sister, Emily Michelle (who is adopted); our dog, Shannon; our cranky cat, Boo\u2011Boo; other assorted pets; and our resident ghost, Ben Brewer.\n\nI popped a fly into right field. Nicky circled under it, lost it in the sun, and dropped it off the tip of his glove.\n\n\"Play it out!\" I called.\n\nBut Nicky didn't appear to hear me. He froze, glove outstretched, knees half-bent, his eyes focused on something behind me.\n\nThoughts of the ghostly Ben Brewer crossed my mind. Had he come to haunt our team?\n\n\"Nicky!\" I called.\n\nNicky started to trot in toward home plate. As he reached the infield, he broke into a run down the first base line.\n\n\"Nicky? Nicky, is something \u2014\"\n\n\"Hey!\" Nicky shouted at the top of his lungs. \"Hey! Hey, Derek!\"\n\nWhen they heard that, the other kids turned and looked, too. Then they all broke rank, running from the field, speeding past me toward the Mercedes\u2011Benz station wagon nudged up to the curb at the edge of the park.",

She looked at the Benz, she looked at the crowd of excited kids, and she looked at me. \"Derek Masters? As in, Derek Masters the kid TV and movie star?\"\n\n\"The very same,\" I said. \"He filmed his TV movie Little Vampires right here in good old Stoneybrook.\"\n\nAbby raised her eyebrows. \"Rats. I thought when I moved to Stoneybrook that I was the most monster star this town had ever seen.\"\n\nI groaned and rolled my eyes. \"Derek's a star, but he's a cool kid,\" I said. By the time I reached the station wagon, the whole team had crowded around it, talking and laughing. I saw Derek's mother at the steering wheel. She waved at me, smiling.\n\n\"Let me out!\" Derek said, laughing himself, as he tried to push open the door of the car. At last, with Nicky's help, he managed to swing the door open and slide out.\n\nHe and Nicky grinned at each other. Nicky has been Derek's Stoneybrook best friend ever since Derek moved here.\n\n\"Are you here to make another movie?\" Karen asked.\n\n\"How long can you stay?\" asked Nicky.\n\n\"You want to practice with us?\" asked Claire.\n\nBut before Derek",

          "text": "\"Claudia! I didn't know you were going to stop by today.\" My mom stood in the doorway leading to her office behind the main desk at the Stoneybrook Public Library.\n\nI have to admit that the library isn't my favorite place, even though my mom is the head librarian. That's because books and I, Claudia Kishi, don't mix very well \u2014 especially school books. Nancy Drew books are a different story. I have them hidden all over my room so I can read one anytime I feel like it. They're hidden because my mom and dad don't consider Nancy Drew \"worthwhile reading.\"\n\nBut today I was surrounded by all kinds of worthwhile reading and Mom looked a little surprised as she walked out from behind the desk and gave me a hug. She was wearing a pair of earrings I'd made her: tiny books that really open, hanging from silver wires. The earrings were the only thing that saved her outfit from being totally boring. She wore a plain black skirt and a plain red blouse, and it made her look like \u2014 a librarian. There's nothing wrong with that exactly, but I wouldn't be caught dead in anything so ordinary.\n\nClothes are sort of a hobby for me. I try never to wear the same outfit twice. Today I had on navy blue pants with wide legs, red suspenders decorated with big sunbursts, a white T-shirt, and over it all, a huge red-and-white-checked shirt. My earrings were also bright yellow sunbursts that I made to match the suspenders. My hair was in one long braid hanging down my back, tied with a red-and-white-checked bow. Except for the fact that we're both Japanese-American and have the same color hair and eyes, no one would ever guess that Mom and I are related.\n\nThis doesn't mean I love my mom less. In fact, my entire family is pretty cool, even if they don't look it. My dad's a partner in an investment firm in Stamford, the city nearest to Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where we live. I have one sister, Janine. Mom wouldn't be a bit surprised if she turned up at the library. That's because Janine is a full-fledged, authentic genius, with the IQ to prove it. She loves school, books, computers, and all of that stuff. She's a junior at Stoneybrook High School, but she also takes classes at Stoneybrook University in all kinds of things I can't pronounce, let alone spell or understand.",

Of course, Mom didn't know that, and she asked (hopefully, I thought), \"Are you working on an assignment for school?\" When I was in eighth grade and often behind, Mom, Dad, and Janine pitched in to help me with my homework, so you can see why Mom would be excited to think that I might be getting a head start on it. My grandmother, Mimi, used to help too, but she died not long ago. I still miss her.\n\n\"I'm trying to find out something about Grandmother Madden, an artist,\" I said, once again shattering my mom's hopes that some of Janine was rubbing off on me. Although I know my parents are every bit as proud of me as they are of my sister, I think they wish I were a little more like her in some ways. Then again, maybe they wish she were like me in some ways.\n\n\"Grandmother Madden?\" Mom looked blank. \"What's her full name?\"\n\n\"Grandmother Madden,\" I repeated. \"That's how she signed her artwork and how she's known. She's a folk artist who painted in the primitive style, and she used to live here in Stoneybrook. I'm baby\u2011sitting for her great\u2011grandson tomorrow. His mom inherited her grandmother's house and is getting it ready to sell.\"\n\nRight in front of my eyes Mom changed into Superlibrarian. I could almost see the outline of a cape trailing behind her. \"We can look under Madden, primitive art, folk art, local artists,\" Mom said as I followed her to the electronic card catalog. Using the electronic card catalog is something I learned to do almost as soon as I learned to read. Mom knew this, but I could tell she wanted to find out about Grandmother Madden too. There are no limits to Superlibrarian's curiosity.\n\nWe didn't find anything under Madden, but there was a book called Primitive Artists of the Twentieth Century and another with the title Folk Art.\n\nAgain I followed Mom, to the shelves this time. (She didn't even have to write down the call numbers of the books.) But neither book was there.\n\nBeing the head librarian, my mom has her ways of finding out where a book is at all times (thanks to her superpowers and the computer). She clicked a few keys and discovered that both books were checked out. \"They're due in at the end of next week. We can put a request in, so you'll be notified when they come back,\" Mom said, still typing.\n\n\"It won't help me for tomorrow, but go ahead,\" I said. I'd become pretty interested in folk art, and I wanted to find out more about it.\n\n\"Wait a minute. Did you say she used to live here in Stoneybrook?\" Mom's eyebrows came together and she drummed her fingers on the checkout desk.\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Maybe there's been something about her in the newspaper.\" Mom took off again, and I followed again.

Basically, there's an organ in your body called the pancreas, which is supposed to make a hormone called insulin, which helps regulate your blood sugar. Well, your pancreas may be doing its job, but mine sure isn't. So I have to help it out, by testing my blood sugar regularly, injecting myself with insulin every day (it sounds awful, but I'm used to it), and being careful about what I eat. I mean very careful. If I don't eat right, I can become extremely sick. (That's why I'd brought a snack \u2014 Wheat Thins and an apple \u2014 with me on the train. I knew it would be a long time before dinner.)\n\nOh, one other thing about diabetes. It's not like a cold or the flu that makes you feel miserable for a little while and then you recover. It's a lifelong disease. Maybe I'll be lucky and someone will come up with a cure during my lifetime, but for now I have to take the long view and cope with it the best I can. Diabetes can make you feel different, apart from other people. I try not to let it do that. Even though I'm constantly aware of my health, even though I've been to more doctors than most people four times my age, even though I could get seriously ill eating a chocolate bar, I always try to remember that I'm more than just a diabetes patient. I'm a person who happens to have diabetes.",

It hasn't been long since we first met, yet I feel as if I've known him all my life. He's sweet and funny and caring, and I can talk with him about anything. We've had a few ups and downs but now we're definitely up. He also happens to rate about a gazillion on the hunk\u2011o\u2011meter: long, almost black hair, a tiny gold hoop in one ear ... sigh.\n\nBut my relationship with Ethan goes way beyond caring how he looks. This thing with Ethan is different, new. I've gone out with plenty of boys. In fact, I have to admit (blush, blush) I even used to be a little boy\u2011crazy. There was Toby, at Sea City, and Sam, my friend Kristy's older brother. There was Wes, the student teacher I had a Texas\u2011sized crush on, and Pierre, my first boyfriend\u2011on\u2011skis. I went out briefly with Terry, a mysterious boy who lived in Stoneybrook only for a short time, and with RJ, one of the more popular boys at school, and with Pete, and with Ross.",

He was on the basketball team when we first met, and I loved watching him play. Robert and I went out for quite awhile. It wasn't a perfect relationship, but we worked through the hard times. Then, not long ago, we broke up for good. I think the breakup was a long time coming, but that didn't make it any easier when it finally happened. I was hurt because he'd started seeing another girl, with whom I was sort of friendly, before we'd even broken up. Yuck.\n\nThat's all history now. I'm over Robert, and I imagine he's over Andi Gentile. (That's the girl he was seeing. She goes to SMS too.) Sometimes I wonder, though. Lately I've seen Robert looking gloomy when I pass him in the halls at school. He used to be cheerful, always laughing and joki",

          "text": "I looked up from my book and listened carefully. Outside the windows all I saw were gray skies and rain. All I heard was drip, drip, drip. Or was that all? It seemed as if there might be another noise, something I could feel as well as hear. I strained to pinpoint the source, wanting to know for sure, but it seemed as if it came from everywhere.\n\nWas it rain or the sound of a beating heart?\n\nI shut the book I'd been reading, as if the sound were coming from inside it. The sound wasn't, but the idea of the sound of a beating heart had come directly from the story I'd just finished, \"The Tell\u2011Tale Heart,\" by Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nIn the story, the main character murders an old man because he doesn't like the man's eye (it was the eye of a vulture, according to the killer). After the man is dead, the killer hides the body under the floor. The police come to search the house, because a neighbor reported a strange noise. The killer is so sure that the police won't be able to detect any evidence of the murder that he tells them to sit in the dead man's bedroom, directly over the spot where he'd hidden the body. But then he hears the sound of a beating heart, and it beats louder and louder. Finally, it grows so loud that the man is sure the police are making fun of him by pretending not to hear. He confesses to his crime, because of the beating of the victim's \"hideous heart.\"\n\nNow, why had I, someone who can't listen to ghost stories in broad daylight, let alone on an eerie, dreary day, decided to read about such awful things? I was reading Poe for our English project on mysteries. But I wished I'd saved this part of my homework until my dad or Sharon had come home from work.",

          "text": "It's times like this \u2014 dark, stormy, lonely afternoons \u2014 when I miss Dawn more than ever. Dawn is one of my best friends and also my stepsister. She lives in California.\n\nWho am I? I'm Mary Anne Spier, and I was wishing hard that I could put the sound of that beating heart out of my mind. It kept replaying like snatches of an irritating song stuck inside my brain. I turned on every light in the room, glad at least that I was nowhere near the secret passage that leads from our old farmhouse to the barn. It all sounds very mysterious, doesn't it?\n\nI live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, in a farmhouse built in 1795. If Edgar Allan Poe had ever visited Stoneybrook (and a professor from Stoneybrook University told our English class that he had) he would have been here when my house was still fairly new. I flipped to the part of my book that told a little about the author. Poe's stories were so sad and scary that I wondered if he'd been sad \u2014 or scary \u2014 himself. The short biography didn't mention Poe coming to Stoneybrook, but it did say that his mother and father had died when he was very young.\n\nI could understand, better than most, why that would make a person sad. My mother died when I was a baby. However, unlike Poe, I still had my dad to take care of me. And now I also have a stepmother, Sharon, a stepsister, Dawn, and a stepbrother, Jeff. Sharon, Dad, and I live in Stoneybrook, but Dawn and Jeff live most of the year in California with their dad. How we became a family and moved into a farmhouse with a secret passage is a romantic story, not scary at all.\n\nI met Dawn Schafer on her second day at Stoneybrook Middle School (SMS). We were both in seventh grade then. We're in eighth grade now. She was (and still is) tall, blonde, and very pretty. I was (and still am) short, with straight brown hair and brown eyes. I'm also very shy and wouldn't normally go out of my way to make a new friend. But I was in the middle of a fight with my regular friends, and Dawn showed up at the right time.\n\nDawn, her brother, and their mom had moved to Stoneybrook after Mr. and Mrs. Schafer divorced. For Sharon, Dawn's mom, this meant coming home since she'd grown up here. One day, when we were looking through some of Sharon's old yearbooks, we found out that she and my dad had dated each other. But then Sharon went out to California, met Mr. Schafer, and married him. And my dad stayed in Connecticut, became a lawyer, met my mom, and married her.\n\nBy the time Mrs. Schafer returned, both our parents were single again, so Dawn and I did a little matchmaking. Our parents ended up marrying one another after all.\n\nDawn is one of my two best friends. We have a lot in common, including the fact that we both love kids and baby\u2011sitting. Most of my friends share these interests. We belong to a club called the Baby\u2011sitters Club (more about that later), which Dawn also joined.",

Still, I wished she were in the house with me that afternoon.\n\nTigger, my gray\u2011striped kitten, jumped on my lap and began to purr. I petted him. \"You always know when I need a little company, don't you?\" I said to him. He meowed, then curled up on my lap and fell asleep. I wasn't alone. Tigger was good company.",

Allergy season was winding up, which was very, very bad.\n\nMy name's Abby Stevenson, and I'm allergic to just about everything in the universe: dust, shellfish, milk, pollen, dogs. Not cats, though, believe it or not. I am, however, allergic to kitty litter. Go figure, as a New Yorker might say. I know New Yorkese because I'm originally from Long Island. I just moved here (\"here\" is Stoneybrook, Connecticut) recently. Anna and I are thirteen and in the eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School, otherwise known as SMS.\n\nWe've made plenty of new friends. Anna's are mostly kids she knows from music classes, since her life pretty much revolves around her violin (she's an awesome fiddler). Mine are either teammates (I'm kind of a jock) or members of this great club I belong to (the Baby\u2011sitters Club, or BSC \u2014 more about that later). None of our new pals has any trouble telling my twin and me apart, even though we have identical genes. We never dress alike, for one thing, and while we both have thick, curly brown hair, I wear mine long and Anna's is cut short, with bangs. We're both nearsighted, though, and always wear either glasses or contacts.\n\nThat morning, I was wearing my glasses. I hadn't worn contacts for days, since my eyes had been way too itchy. In fact, my eyes were so teary now that I had to take off my glasses to wipe them again. Then I sneezed, for the thirtieth time since I'd woken up. After the sneeze, I coughed a little. My throat was feeling scratchier by the minute.\n\nMy mother looked up again, and concern showed in her eyes. \"I wish I didn't have a late meeting today,\" she said. \"I don't like the way that cough sounds.\" My mom worries about me a bit, because along with the allergies I also have asthma, which, when I have attacks, leaves me gasping for air. I can usually control the asthma with my prescription inhalers. But a couple of times I've had really bad attacks that landed me in the ER. Scary.\n\n\"I'll be fide,\" I said. While I don't always love the hours my mom keeps \u2014 she's a high\u2011powered editor at a New York publishing house \u2014 I know her job means a lot to her, and I didn't want her to skip an important meeting. \"I took by bedicide. I'll be feelig better sood.\" I coughed a little more.\n\n\"Well, at least let me make you a cup of herbal tea. It's good for your throat,\" said Mom. She stood up and headed for the stove.\n\n\"Thanks.\" I reached for the newspaper. Just then, I heard a roar from outside. \"Oh, do!\" I moaned.\n\n\"He's at it again,\" said Anna, craning her neck to peer out the kitchen window.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" muttered my mom. She was at the sink now, filling the teakettle with water as she glared out the window. \"Why can't he do that just a little bit later? Doesn't he realize that some people might still be trying to sleep?\" She banged the kettle down on the stove and snapped on a burner.\n\nThe roar continued. It was Mr. Finch, our backyard neighbor, mowing his lawn. I didn't like the noise, but even more, I dreaded the newly cut grass. It never fails to make my allergies worse.\n\n\"Maybe I should talk to him,\" murmured Mom. \"Ask him to wait until at least nine. Especially on weekends. I mean, eight is too early on a Monday, but remember last Saturday, when he started at seven\u2011thirty?\" She stood by the window, watching.\n\nI didn't even look. I could picture the scene. Mr. Finch was a fastidious home owner, and he mowed his lawn at least twice a week, always early in the morning. He also clipped every stray blade of grass and weeded the walkways until the yard looked ready for a military inspection. He didn't have any flower beds, but I imagined that if he did, the tulips would be lined up in straight rows and the roses would be pruned to within an inch of their lives.\n\nMr. Finch had moved into his house at about the same time we'd moved into ours. He didn't appear to have any family living with him, nor did we ever see friends stop by to visit. Mr. Finch was not a particularly neighborly neighbor; I couldn't imagine him dropping over for a cup of coffee or inviting us to a spontaneous backyard barbecue. No, Mr. Finch kept to himself, and I wasn't sorry. He didn't seem like a very friendly person.\n\n\"Don't bother talking to him, Mom,\" Anna advised. \"I have a feeling Mr. Finch doesn't care if the noise bugs us. And after all, he has to listen to me practice for hours every afternoon.\"\n\n\"That's different,\" said my mother. \"Your violin is hardly as noisy as his lawn mower, and the way you play, even scales sound delightful.\" She turned away from the window to bring me a steaming mug of tea. \"Still, you're probably right. I have better things to do with my time. Speaking of which,\" she continued, glancing at her watch, \"I have a train to catch.\" She picked up her cup for one last gulp of coffee, then put it down and grabbed her briefcase. \"See you two around eight,\" she said, giving us each a quick hug. \"Try to take it easy today,\" she told me seriously. \"No racing around.\"",

Remember, you have to count to a hundred and fifty by fives before you can start looking for us.\n\n'I know, I know,' said David Michael, my younger brother. He and Karen Brewer, our stepsister, are the same age (seven), but Karen can be bossy.\n\nThe three of us (I'm Kristy Thomas) were in our backyard. It was one of those warm, lazy late-summer afternoons, and the sun was just starting to sink. It had been a beautiful day, and we'd spent most of it outdoors. When Karen had suggested a game of hide\u2011and\u2011seek, David Michael and I agreed right away. None of us was in any hurry to go inside. We had plenty of time before supper.\n\n'Okay, here I go!' David Michael cried. He leaned against a tree, hiding his face in his arms. Then he began to count, 'Five, ten, fifteen \u2014'\n\nKaren and I grinned at each other, then took off in opposite directions. I glanced back once, in time to see her diving behind a giant fern. Good spot, I thought. Now, where am I going to hide? I ran toward a huge, old tree trunk. That's it, I said to myself. By then, David Michael was up to ninety\u2011five. Not a moment to waste. I ducked behind the tree and crouched down.",

Long ago, it was just me and my older brothers, Charlie and Sam. They were the ones who taught me all the important kid games. Then David Michael was born, and not long after that everything changed. My dad walked out on our family, and the fun times were over for a while.\n\nBut my mom, otherwise known as Super\u2011woman (secret identity: Elizabeth Thomas), held our family together. She was amazing. She made sure we always had food to eat and clothes to wear. She also taught us to enjoy life and to go for whatever we want out of it.\n\nMom deserves the best, and she found it when she met Watson Brewer, who is now my stepdad. He's an awesome guy, though I'll admit that I didn't recognize that right away. Sweet, funny, caring \u2014 you couldn't ask for a nicer man. And on top of it all, he's an actual millionaire.\n\nKaren is Watson's daughter from his first marriage. I adore having a little sister, so I'm lucky to have two! Besides Karen, there's Emily Michelle, who's just a toddler. She was born in Vietnam. Mom and Watson adopted her not long after they were married. (Soon after Emily arrived, my grandmother Nannie moved in with us, to help out.)\n\nWatson also has a son, a four\u2011year\u2011old named Andrew. He's a great kid, and I miss him a lot. Right now he's living with his mom and stepdad in Chicago. They're spending six months there. He and Karen used to split their time between their mom and Watson. Now (temporarily) Andrew's mostly with his mom, and Karen's mostly with us.\n\nWe all live in Watson's gigantic mansion, which is way across town from where I grew up. ('Town' is Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where I've lived all my life.) I'm thirteen now and in the eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. Most of my friends still live in my old neighborhood, but I see them pretty often, since I'm over there three times a week for BSC meetings. The BSC is the Baby\u2011sitters Club, and I never miss a meeting because I happen to be president. But more about that later.",

You didn't have to tackle me so hard.\"\n\n\"Sorry.\" King smiled and reached down to help me. \"Guess I'm stronger than I think, huh?\"\n\nI like King, but modesty is not one of his strong points. (Neither is a sense of humor \u2014 just watch the smoke come out of his ears if you call him \"Clarence.\")\n\nAs I got to my feet, I could hear Coach Mills call out, \"Look alive, you two!\"\n\nI trotted toward the line of scrimmage, feeling a little wobbly ... and suddenly looking forward to the end of the season.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. I like football a lot. But some guys play as if there are NFL scouts hanging out at every practice. As for me, well, I'm in it for the fun. That's the way I run my life. Do what you enjoy, I always say. Even if people think you're a little weird. Even if they make fun of you and call you a girl, just because ...\n\nWhoa. I'm getting ahead of myself.

Anyway, the fact that I'm a guy is crucial to this story, so I should say it right out.\n\nLet's see, what else do you need to know about me....\n\nI'm thirteen, and I'm in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School (SMS) in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. Originally I'm from Louisville, Kentucky \u2014 and according to some people, I sound like it. I get teased for my drawl, but my so-called accent sounds pretty normal to me. I'm always amazed at how strange northerners talk. Fast, fast, fast, like there's some kind of time limit on sentences.\n\nYou probably already guessed my main interest is sports. Well, three of my main interests are football, baseball, and track. Not that I'm a stereotypical jock. I don't eat steaks for breakfast, grunt when I talk, or have trouble counting past my own weight. (Actually, I don't know any athletes like that ... although King comes close.) I don't even look very jockish. I'm average height and I have an average build. My hair is blondish brown and my eyes are blue. Mary Anne Spier, my girl-friend, says I look like Cam Geary, this movie star, but she's definitely exaggerating.\n\nAs for Mary Anne, well, she's the other main interest in my life. Oops, wait a minute, that sounds terrible. I didn't mean other. It's just that I've been involved in sports longer, so ... oh, you know what I mean. Just don't tell Mary Anne I said that. She's very sensitive. In fact, her sensitivity and shyness are the coolest things about her. I'm just the opposite \u2014 a take-charge kind of person, sometimes even bullheaded. You might think that would create personality problems between us. Well, you're right. We've had our ups and downs. We even broke up for awhile, because Mary Anne felt I was stifling her. I used to decide everything\u2014when and where we were going on a date, what movies we would see, what we'd eat. I wouldn't pay attention to Mary Anne's baby-sitting schedule or even ask her if she wanted to go somewhere. I just assumed.\n\nIt's not that I was being a jerk. Like I said, she's very shy, and sometimes I didn't know what she was thinking. So I figured she would be happy to let me make the decisions. Anyway, things kind of blew up. I began getting impatient with her shyness, she began resenting my forcefulness. It was a real mess. She ended up breaking it off. It was tough for both of us, but I think the time off helped. When we got around to talking again, we really figured things out. We started seeing each other again, and now we're getting along better than ever.\n\nMaybe you noticed I mentioned Mary Anne's baby-sitting schedule. That's a big part of her life. In case you didn't know, she and her friends belong to this group called the Baby-sitters Club.",

I have a younger brother and sister and I baby\u2011sit for them a lot.\n\nAnyway, that's a roundabout way of getting to the next important thing about myself.\n\nI, Logan Bruno, also belong to the Baby\u2011sitters Club.\n\nSort of.\n\nI'm an associate member, which means I don't go to regular meetings or pay dues. I just fill in when things get busy.\n\nI hope it doesn't sound like I'm ashamed of belonging to the BSC, because I'm not. It's just that, well, I've had to take a little razzing about it from some of my friends.\n\nA little? OK \u2014 a lot!\n\nActually, it wasn't so bad at first. Most of the guys didn't even know I had this \"secret life\" as a baby\u2011sitter. And besides, I wasn't needed too much by the club, so I could always work my sitting jobs around my practice schedule. I like kids a lot, so it was fun and easy.\n\nUntil recently, that is.

(Actually he is the Prince of Allergies, so it came out more like \"Bo syrup odd by waffles!\")\n\n\"Hrmmph \u2026 ?\" grunted my dad as he sipped his coffee.\n\n\"Pleeease!\" Hunter added quickly. \"It all soaked in!\"\n\nDad made a face. \"Honey, is the half\u2011and\u2011half sour?\" he asked my mother.\n\n\"No!\" Mom said to Hunter. Then she sniffed the half\u2011and\u2011half carton. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"No?\" Dad repeated. \"Funny. Could it be the coffee?\"\n\nMom sighed. \"I said \u2014\"\n\nBang! My sister Kerry slammed the door to the cereal cabinet. \"Who ate all the Cheerios?\"\n\n\"I did,\" Hunter said with a grin. \"Yesterday.\"\n\n\"Pig!\"\n\n\"Mo\u2011om, Kerry called me a \u2014\"\n\n\"A little less noise, please,\" Dad said.\n\n\"We have corn flakes,\" Mom suggested.\n\n\"Ewwww, I'd rather eat cardboard!\" Kerry wailed.\n\n\"Okay! I'll get some!\" Hunter hopped off his chair.\n\n\"Sit down!\" That was Mom, Dad, and Kerry in unison.\n\nWelcome to the Bruno kitchen. It was seven AM on a typical Monday. Total chaos. What a way to begin the week.\n\nMe? I was feeling as if I'd been run over by a truck.\n\nOkay, here's the first thing you should know about me. I, Logan Bruno, am not a morning person. I'm a nice guy most of the day. But pre\u2011breakfast? Forget it. Call me Draculogan.\n\nHere are some things you should know about the post\u2011breakfast me. I lose my fangs and become a pretty normal thirteen\u2011year\u2011old boy. I'm in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School in Stoneybrook, Connecticut \u2014 but I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky. I guess I have an accent, but if you ask me, it's the people up North who talk funny (and way too fast). I like sports, but I'm not a hard\u2011core jock. Which means I can walk and talk at the same time, and I don't carry a football to bed with me. (Well, no jocks are like that, really, but some people conjure up this stereotype \u2026 ) I look pretty average, medium height with blue eyes and blondish brown hair. My girlfriend, Mary Anne Spier, says I look like the actor Cam Geary. I don't, exactly, but I just thought I'd say that so you don't think I look like Garth from Wayne's World or something.\n\nAnyway, while we're on my favorite subject (Mary Anne, not Garth), I should mention I was supposed to meet her at seven\u2011thirty at Brenner Field. I had almost forgotten.\n\n\"Morning,\" I said as I slipped into the kitchen. Quickly I poured myself some cereal and grabbed a banana.\n\n\"Morning,\" said Dad.\n\n\"Morning,\" said Mom.\n\n\"Morning,\" said Hunter.\n\n\"Ohhhhhh,\" said Kerry, slumping into her seat.\n\n\"You okay?\" I asked.\n\nShe shook her head. \"Uh\u2011uh. I don't feel so good.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Mom asked.\n\n\"She's going to barf!\" Hunter said happily. \"Ew! Ew!\"\n\n\"I am not!\" Kerry snapped back. \"I think I just need a little rest.\"\n\nDad raised a suspicious eyebrow. \"I'll call Doctor Kahn and set up an appointment.\"\n\n\"No!\" Kerry shot back.\n\nI tried to look her in the eye, but she turned away. Aha! I, Dr. Bruno, could detect telltale signs of the Kerry Bruno Anti\u2011School Virus.\n\nShe last had the \"symptoms\" when we moved to Stoneybrook. They would appear mysteriously every weekday morning. And they finally went away when Kerry began to make friends.\n\nI felt bad for her that Monday. Something was bugging her, and she wasn't saying what it was. Mom and Dad were determined to make her go to school.\n\nAs for me, I decided to stay out of the fireworks. I scarfed down my breakfast, grabbed my backpack, and ran out the door.\n\n\" 'Bye!\" I called out. \"Good luck, Kerry!\"\n\n\" 'Bye, Logan!\" Hunter called back.\n\nI ran out the door.",

          "text": "I jogged down Fawcett Avenue and across Brenner Field. I could see Mary Anne on the other side. She was wearing earphones and tapping her feet to some song. \"Hi!\" I yelled, and I broke into a sprint.\n\nShe took off the phones and started to applaud. As I got closer, she called out, \"How can you do that?\"\n\nI put my arm around her shoulder. \"Do what?\"\n\n\"Run like that so early in the morning.\"\n\n\"Must be the pork chops I had for breakfast,\" I said. \"Lots of protein.\"\n\n\"Gross!\"\n\n\"At least I didn't fall down.\"\n\nMary Anne's brow crinkled. \"Oh, Logan, you're still thinking about the meet, aren't you?\"\n\nTalk about sensitive. Mary Anne is incredible; sometimes she can tell what's on my mind before I say a word. It is definitely one of the coolest things about her, right up there with a great sense of humor, deep brown eyes, and the most amazing smile. Seriously, if you could take and bottle Mary Anne's smile, it could probably cure grouchiness throughout the world. I felt better just looking at her.\n\nI know, I know, I sound corny when I start talking about Mary Anne. (Well, you would too, if she were your girlfriend. Nuff said.)\n\nI guess I should tell you what Mary Anne was talking about. I'm on the SMS track team, and we'd had a meet that Saturday. Our opponent, Mercer Junior High, was ahead by a point going into the last event, the hundred\u2011yard dash. Now, that's my event and I'm pretty good at it. In practice I had tied the county all\u2011time record. I was all fired up to beat it.\n\nI never reached the finish line. I fell. Just flat\u2011out tripped on my own feet. Too excited, I guess.\n\nWe lost the meet. I was pretty embarrassed. (Embarrassed? I felt like moving out of town.) Fortunately I had gotten over it by Monday.\n\nI shrugged. \"Nah, we didn't lose any ground in the standings. I'm not really thinking about it anymore.\"\n\n\"Okay \u2026\" Mary Anne didn't believe me. I could tell.\n\nWe began walking toward school, and I wanted to change the subject. \"What were you listening to?\"\n\n\"Nicky Cash,\" she said.\n\nI should have known. Mary Anne had only been listening to that tape for weeks.\n\nI told you she was sensitive, right? Well, here's an example. Nicky Cash is this teenage singer who records all these gooshy love songs. Mary Anne always cries when she listens to him. Now, if someone made you cry, wouldn't that be a reason not to listen to him anymore? I'd think so. But Mary Anne can't get enough of his songs.\n\nTo be honest, I can't understand what the big deal is. Nicky Cash doesn't h",

          "text": "\"A sardine chocolate cake,\" I said.\n\nMy sister Maria made a gagging noise and went off into a storm of giggles. When she'd managed to get control of herself, she answered, \"A broccoli milkshake with chopped onions.\"\n\n\"Euuuuuw,\" I said, grabbing my throat and making a face.\n\nMaria began to giggle again.\n\nWe both looked at Tiffany. But she didn't seem to be listening. She just stared out the window as our school bus pulled to a stop in front of our house.\n\nThe three of us got out, Maria with a hop, Tiffany with her head down, and me last, with a wave to the driver. As the bus pulled away, I paused to look up and down our street. The day was bright and quiet and still, and you could feel spring just waiting to happen in Stoneybrook, where we live. My sisters Maria and Tiffany and I had been playing an old game of ours on the bus ride home from Stoneybrook Day School: Gross Food.\n\nAt least, Maria, who is eight, and I had been playing. Tiffany hadn't said anything at all.\n\nI looked over at Tiffany as she walked beside me. Her head was still down and she was holding her backpack across her chest. Maybe now that she was eleven, Tiffany thought she was too old for the Gross Food game. Maybe she thought her older sister (that's me) shouldn't be playing it either. Maybe I'd embarrassed her and that's why she was ignoring us.\n\nOr maybe she hadn't even noticed what Maria and I had been doing. It was hard to tell with Tiffany these days. She'd gotten very quiet lately, even quieter than usual.\n\n\"Marshmallow and spinach pie,\" said Maria.\n\nI smiled. \"Hmm,\" I said. \"That doesn't sound so bad.\"\n\n\"Shannon!\" shrieked Maria in delighted disgust.\n\n\"I'm raising spinach in my garden,\" said Tiffany softly.\n\nI looked back at Tiffany in surprise. She had been listening after all.\n\n\"You are?\" I said.\n\nTiffany nodded. She'd just started a garden in the very back corner of the backyard and was spending hours there these days.\n\n\"Is it hard?\" I asked.\n\n\"No. Spinach grows well in cool weather, like early spring and in the fall,\" answered Tiffany. After a moment, she added, \"Broccoli, too. And cabbage. And peas.\"\n\nMaria, bouncing happily on her toes, said, \"I wish you could grow chocolate in your garden, Tiff.\"\n\nTiffany smiled, but she didn't answer.\n\n\"Maybe it's a good thing you can't,\" I said. \"Chocolate is really bad for dogs, but they love it. Astrid would probably come out and eat any chocolate right up!\"\n\n\"I'm glad I'm not a dog,\" Maria said. \"I'd hate not to get to eat chocolate.\" She paused, then added thoughtfully, \"I'm hungry.\"\n\n\"How about some nice pepper ice cream with garlic sauce?\" I teased.\n\nMaria kept her face straight with an effort. \"I can't,\" she said as we pushed open the door of our house. \"I have swim practice, thank you.\"\n\n\"We're home,\" I called.\n\nMaria bounded off to her room to get her swimming gear. As silently as a fish in water, Tiffany slipped away. I had a feeling she would be changing out of her school uniform and into gardening clothes.\n\nI headed for my room.\n\n\"Shannon?\" My mother's voice came from the den.\n\nI stopped and looked in. My mother was sitting on the couch holding a book. \"Did you have a good day at school?\"\n\n\"Same as always,\" I said.\n\n\"No new teachers? New friends? New news? What about your club meeting?\"\n\n\"The Baby-sitters Club meets on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Mom,\" I said. \"Today is Thursday.\"\n\n\"Oh. Right.\" My mom nodded and smiled. I smiled back.\n\nSome people think my mother and I look alike, but I think she and Tiffany look more alike. All three of us have thick, blonde hair and blue eyes and high cheekbones. But my mom and Tiffany wear their hair short and I wear mine long. And they both have these incredible dark eyelashes. I have to wear black mascara every day to make my eyelashes as dark as theirs. It's funny how families look alike in such mixed-up ways. My face is longer, shaped more like my father's. He's not very tall, and I'm not going to be really tall either, I can tell. But Mom is tall, and so is Tiffany and so is Maria. Maria, however, has the same dark coloring as my father and his brown eyes. If you looked at us altogether, though, you'd know we are related, that we're a family.\n\n\"An anchovy cheese slush!\" cried Maria, skidding down the hall outside the den.\n\n\"Maria, slow down!\" said my mother. Hearing my mother say that was funny, because she moves at hyper-speed a lot herself, just the way Maria does.\n\n\"Can't,\" said Maria breathlessly. \"I've got to go to swim practice.\"\n\nJust at that moment, a car horn sounded outside. \"That's my ride!\" exclaimed Maria.\n\n\"A peanut butter and ketchup sandwich,\" I called after Maria as she bolted for the door.\n\n\"Euuuuuw,\" she said. The door slammed behind her, cutting her off.\n\n\"The Gross Food game,\" said my mother. \"How about \u2014 chocolate-grapefruit sundae?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Mom. Sometimes I think chocolate goes with everything.\"\n\nMy mom laughed a little. \"That's true. Well, then ... a ... a ...\"\n\nI laughed a little, too. \"I think Maria might be the family champion at this. I'd better go start on my homework.\"\n\n\"Shannon? I was thinking of taking Astrid for a walk. Do you want to come along?\"\n\nI stopped and turned around.\n\n\"I really have to get my homework done,\" I said. \"Thanks anyway. I'll take Astrid later if you want.\"\n\nMy mother looked disappointed for a moment. Then she said, \"Maybe Tiffany will want to go.\"\n\n\"Well, if she doesn't, I'll make it an extra-long walk for Astrid,\" I promised. \"As soon as I get the math out of the way.\"\n\n\"If you change your mind,\" my mother said.\n\n\"I'll let you know,\" I finished. I walked down the hall and up the stairs to my room.\n\nPutting my books down on my desk, I looked out the window. Tiffany was already hard at work on her garden, with Astrid sitting nearby, watching attentively. Tiffany had changed out of the SDS uniform and was wearing faded jeans, sneakers, a big, grubby sweat shirt, and some old gloves that looked too large for her. Probably my father's, I thought. He'd b",

          "text": "That was the first thing I wrote for my summer English project. I had to write a l-o-n-g composition during vacation. That\u2019s because I didn\u2019t exactly pass English this year. (You may have noticed that my spelling is pretty bad.) I\u2019m one of those people who have a lot of trouble with writing and reading. Even when I try my best, I\u2019m always making mistakes in spelling, and I\u2019m a very slow reader. Don\u2019t feel too sorry for me, though, because I\u2019m talented in anything that has to do with color and design. (Sorry if that sounds conceited, but that\u2019s what everyone says about me.) My friends say that I have a unique sense of style, too, and it shows in the way I dress. I have this knack for putting odd pieces of clothing and accessories together in ways that really work. I just don\u2019t have a knack for putting letters and words together. Fortunately, my English teacher, Mrs. Hall, understands my problem. She gave me extra help during the school year. But I still failed. Mrs. Hall was almost as disappointed as I was. So she came up with this idea that if I wrote a very good composition over the summer, maybe I could raise my grade in English to a passing level. When I asked her what I should write about, she said to write about anything I wanted and that it could be fiction (you know, made up) or nonfiction (something that really happened). I like fiction, especially mysteries. I\u2019m a big Nancy Drew fan. But since I\u2019m not the type who can imagine stories like that and write them down, I was left with nothing to write about but the truth. So I decided to take notes on what happened to me every day, like a diary. Toward the end of summer I\u2019d read over my diary and use it as an outline for a composition. The day I wrote my first entry in my diary was the day I agreed to sit for Karen and Andrew Brewer. I got the job through this great club I belong to \u2014 the Baby\u2011sitters Club, or BSC. In fact, Karen and Andrew are the stepsister and stepbrother of the BSC\u2019s president, Kristy Thomas. Kristy is president partly because she started the club, but mostly because she\u2019s the best person for the job. She\u2019s smart and organized. She also has a take\u2011charge, no\u2011nonsense kind of personality. Believe me, that\u2019s what you need to keep the BSC running smoothly. Anyway, as I said, I began the notes for my summer writing project with that entry about baby\u2011sitting for Karen and Andrew. As I closed my notebook I was more than a little worried that my composition was going to turn out to be boring with a capital B. Why would Mrs. Hall \u2014 or anyone else for that matter \u2014 want to read about me and a couple of kids looking for things to do on hot summer days? It would end up being a boring story about people trying not to be bored. As it turned out, what happened to me, my friends, and our baby\u2011sitting charges was as exciting as any made\u2011up story, even a Nancy Drew mystery. I could never have imagined that soon we would all be spending two weeks in a haunted house.",

One of us even has homework this summer.\\\" I bit into a Twinkie for comfort. \\\"I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do a good job on the composition, Claud,\\\" Mary Anne said. \\\"Don\u2019t worry about it.\\\" Mary Anne cares a lot about people, and tries to make everyone feel good. But even sweet Mary Anne wanted a break from sitting. \\\"It does seem like we\u2019re awfully busy,\\\" she told Kristy. \\\"Look,\\\" Kristy said, \\\"you guys elected me president. I\u2019m just carrying out my duties. I know what\u2019s best for the club.\\\" After a few seconds of stony silence we started talking again about what we would do with our free time, if we had any. \\\"The beach,\\\" Dawn said. \\\"I\u2019d go into the ocean and not come out until Labor Day.\\\" Out of the corner of my eye I could see Kristy watching the clock. She was determined to start the meeting on time. No slacking off just because it was vacation! I guess it sounds as if all we do at our meetings is bicker. But it wasn\u2019t five\u2011thirty yet, so the meeting hadn\u2019t officially started. Besides, everyone was pretty wound up over the last day of school. Anyway, I\u2019d better fill you in on all this Baby\u2011sitters Club stuff. The idea of the BSC is that we work together to provide a baby\u2011sitting service. We meet three afternoons a week \u2014 Monday, Wednesday, and Friday \u2014 from five\u2011thirty to six. Our clients know that\u2019s when to call to make baby\u2011sitting arrangements for their kids. The BSC always meets in my room. Why? Because I have my own phone line, which means our club calls don\u2019t tie up anybody\u2019s family phone. Another feature my room offers is a good supply of junk food. I collect it and share it. No one goes hungry during a BSC meeting, not even Dawn, who\u2019s into health food. That\u2019s why, while we were complaining about our overstuffed schedules, I was looking for something heal",

But it wasn\u2019t until we were in the middle of this mystery that I realized we should be keeping a mystery notebook, too.\n\nToo? Well, we already keep a club notebook. In it, we write about each and every baby-sitting job we have: who, where, when, what happened, and whatever else we think might be important. The club notebook is a handy reference tool. We\u2019re able to keep up with what is going on in the lives of our baby-sitting charges, and with any habits or changes we need to know about, such as allergies, teething problems, or phobias. We use the information to solve problems, too.\n\nSo it seems only logical that we should record our detective work. Reporting strange occurrences, and keeping a list of suspects and clues, could help solve the mystery.\n\nOf course, as usual, when this mystery began, we didn\u2019t know it was a mystery right away. But once I realized what was happening, I decided to persuade everybody to think back and write up the incidents that marked the beginning of the mystery.\n\nI can be very persuasive.\n\nWe now have a BSC mystery notebook.\n\nI just wish I\u2019d thought of it sooner, because the BSC has, as I mentioned, been involved in a number of mysteries. Such as the time Dawn Schafer realized that there was a pet-napping ring here in Stoneybrook, when certain breeds of dogs started disappearing. Or the time we all had jobs at the mall as part of a school project, and we discovered that someone was involved in a lot more than shop-lifting. And the time Claudia spotted a clue in a photograph and ended up helping to solve \u2026\n\nWell, anyway, you get the idea.\n\nWe know our way around a mystery. This mystery, however, was a lot scarier than the others. Creepy. Like something you see in horror movies.\n\nIt started as a simple vacation.

She was asleep. I had just finished overseeing Andrew\u2019s bath, and he was enjoying staying up \u201creally late.\u201d (I\u2019d told him he could stay up as late as he liked as long as he stayed in bed. I\u2019d left him sitting bolt upright, looking at picture books. I knew from past experience that half an hour later, he\u2019d be fast asleep.)\n\nMy maternal grandmother, Nannie, was with her bowling league; Charlie, my oldest brother (who\u2019s seventeen), was at a basketball tournament; and my brother Sam (fifteen) was out on a date breaking up with his current girlfriend (although I didn\u2019t know that at the time). My mother and Watson, my stepfather, had gone to a Christmas party.\n\nShannon, David Michael\u2019s Bernese mountain dog puppy, was asleep on the sofa in the den. Boo\u2011Boo, the cranky cat, was lurking somewhere in the house, no doubt waiting to claw whomever was unwary enough to walk by. The other assorted Brewer\u2011Thomas pets, such as the goldfish, were, I hoped, in their proper places. And the ghost of Ben Brewer (an ancestor of Watson\u2019s), who \u2014 Karen firmly believes \u2014 lives on the third floor, was, I also hoped, in his room for the night.\n\nThat is my family.

It\u2019s Wednesday.\"\n\nKristy Thomas, president of the Baby-sitters Club, was in what my mother calls a \u201ctizzy.\u201d We were leaving for the Halloween retreat to Salem the next morning, and Kristy was preparing to leave someone else in charge of the BSC.\n\n\u201cWonderful Wednesday,\u201d I said, closing the door of Claudia Kishi\u2019s room behind me.\n\n\u201cAbby,\u201d said Kristy, checking her watch. \u201cYou\u2019re \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRight on time. Take it easy, Madame President. We\u2019re only going to be gone four days. What could happen in four days?\u201d (The answer to that question, in case you\u2019re interested, is lots. But I didn\u2019t know that then.)\n\nMary Anne Spier, who is the secretary of the BSC, held up the club notebook. \u201cI have the notebook, which I am about to hand to Mallory for her update. I have the record book. So quit worrying.\u201d\n\nThe phone rang. Kristy shrieked, \u201cThe phone! Where is the phone?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere it always is, Kristy.\u201d Claudia, who\u2019d been delicately picking all the yellow M&Ms out of a giant bag, reached out and scooped up the receiver. \u201cBaby-sitters Club,\u201d she said. She asked some questions, scribbled a few notes, and hung up. \u201cThe Hobarts,\u201d she announced. \u201cFor Sunday afternoon.\u201d\n\nKristy said, \u201cOh, no. We only have four baby-sitters on call. What if \u2014\u201d\n\nCalmly, Mary Anne flipped open the record book. \u201cShannon? Or Jessi? Oops, not Jessi.\u201d\n\nWith a grin, Jessi Ramsey bowed in Shannon Kilbourne\u2019s direction. Jessi is a ballet dancer, and she had a part in Stoneybrook University\u2019s Halloween Dance performance. \u201cYou\u2019re it, Shannon,\u201d Jessi said.\n\n\u201cFine by me,\u201d Shannon answered. Mary Anne wrote down the details of the job in the record book, while Claudia called the Hobarts back to confirm.\n\nKristy calmed down, at least momentarily, and we handled a few more phone calls. Claudia\u2019s bedroom, where we hold our meetings, was packed to overflowing. Not only were the seven regular members of the BSC present, but our two associate members were also present \u2014 at Kristy\u2019s special request. Since five of us would be away for four whole days, she wanted everybody at the meeting.\n\nThis was so that, Kristy-style, she could double- and triple-check every detail, and make plans for everything that might go wrong. As the meeting progressed, she peppered Jessi, Claudia, Shannon, and Logan Bruno with questions: Did everyone have their Kid-Kits? Were they up-to-date with the club notebook? (Yes and yes, and more about the Kid-Kits later.)\n\nSuddenly, Mallory Pike held out her hands toward Kristy, closed her eyes, and intoned, \u201cCalm. You will be calm.\u201d She wriggled her fingers and twitched her nose.\n\nKristy burst out laughing. \u201cWhat are you doing, Mal?\u201d\n\nWith a grin, Mal opened her eyes. \u201cJordan says he has discovered an ancient book of secret spells. He won\u2019t let anybody see it, but he claims he\u2019s been putting spells on Adam and Byron.\u201d Jordan, Adam, and Byron Pike are ten-year-old triplets, younger brothers of Mallory, who is the oldest of eight siblings. Triplets mean triple fun \u2014 and triple trouble. As Mal has said more than once (sometimes proudly and sometimes in despair), in a family as big as hers, there is never a dull moment.\n\n\u201cI wish spells really worked,\u201d said Claudia. \u201cI\u2019d like to put a spell on my homework. Except,\u201d she added darkly, \u201cI think it is already bewitched.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe we can find something in Salem to help you out. After all, the advertisements call it a \u2018bewitching city,\u2019 \u201d said Mary Anne.\n\n\u201cSalem\u2019s not just about witches, you know,\u201d said Stacey McGill unexpectedly. \u201cI mean, America\u2019s first millionaire lived there. And his money came from shipping and trade. Salem used to be an important seaport and the sixth largest town in America.\u201d\n\nClaudia held up her hands. \u201cStop! You sound like a book report. I\u2019d forgotten this trip was a school project and you were going to have to do homework about it. Maybe I should be glad my parents are too worried about my grades to let me go.\u201d\n\n\u201cReports or no reports, I wish our school would plan a trip like that for us,\u201d said Shannon. Shannon goes to a private school, which is why she wasn\u2019t coming on the trip with us. She is one of the associate members of the BSC, and doesn\u2019t come to meetings regularly the way the rest of us do.\n\nLogan is our other associate member. He\u2019s a great baby-sitter and, even more excellently, someone who will play any sport, any time, anywhere. Logan had said no to the trip because of a big football game that weekend. He\u2019s on the SMS football team (and the track team, and the volleyball team, and the baseball team, too).\n\nKristy said, \u201cThe phone number for the inn is listed in information, if you lose it. You just call information for Salem, Massachusetts.\u201d\n\n\u201c1-800-W-I-T-C-H,\u201d I cracked. \u201cSeriously, folks,\u201d I continued, as everyone groaned, \u201chave you taken a look at any of the books on Salem that the teachers have been handing around? There are at least three museums about witches, including a wax museum!\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope they aren\u2019t too scary,\u201d Mary Anne said. \u201cI\u2019d like to take Nidia to some of them. I think she would have fun.\u201d\n\nNidia is the daughter of Ms. Garcia, who was one of the chaperons for the trip, along with Coach Wu (everyone calls her that, even though she teaches social studies as well as coaches the girls\u2019 softball team), Mr. Blake, and Mrs. Bernhardt. Mrs. Bernhardt also teaches social studies. Mrs. Blake and Mr. Wu were coming up to join us that weekend, too. Twenty kids, at least four chaperons \u2026 and how many witches?\n\nAnyway, Ms. Garcia had asked if anyone in the BSC wanted a sitting job during the trip, and Mary Anne had volunteered.\n\n\u201cYeah, you better not scare a teacher\u2019s kid,\u201d I warned Mary Anne. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what that would do to your grade point average.\u201d\n\nReaching down into the briefcase that she carries instead of a backpack these days, Mallory produced a guidebook to Salem and flipped it open.

Our president believes in being On Time and the club secretary, Mary Anne Spier, was one whole minute late.\n\nKristy frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re la \u2014\u201d The words died on her lips as Mary Anne stepped aside and let the person behind her into the room.\n\n\u201cDawn!\u201d cried the normally cool and sophisticated Stacey McGill, leaping to her feet to give Dawn Schafer a hug. We all followed suit, crowding around Dawn to welcome her and bombard her with questions.\n\nThen Kristy remembered what she\u2019d started to say. \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said to Mary Anne. Then she grinned. \u201cBut I guess since our honorary member had to come all the way from California, we can overlook it this time.\u201d\n\nWe laughed. Mary Anne sat down on the floor next to Claudia\u2019s bed, and I scooted over to make room so Dawn could sit between us. We had a very full house. Every single member of the BSC was in attendance. Counting Dawn, that was ten people.\n\n\u201cFirst order of business,\u201d Kristy said. \u201cWelcome back, Dawn. Now, who\u2019s going to be here over the winter holiday?\u201d\n\nI hid a smile. That was typical of Kristy: Business is never far from her mind. Logan Bruno reminded her that he would be going with his family to visit relatives in his home state of Kentucky. Shannon Kilbourne told everyone about the ski vacation her family had planned.\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget that Claudia and I have to leave early today,\u201d Stacey said. \u201cMom\u2019s taking us to the station, to catch our train to New York City.\u201d\n\nMary Anne bent over the club record book, making notes on who was going to be where.",

          "text": "We meet three times a week \u2014 Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, from five-thirty until six \u2014 in Claudia\u2019s bedroom. Why in Claud\u2019s room? Because she has her own phone line, so that we don\u2019t tie up her family\u2019s line when we talk to clients. (That\u2019s one reason Claudia is our vice\u2011president.)\n\nWe meet regularly to make sure there are specific times people can call us to set up baby\u2011sitting appointments. Mary Anne writes all the appointments down in the club record book. The record book also includes our individual schedules (my advanced ballet classes, for example); our clients\u2019 names, addresses, and phone numbers, and rates charged; and special information about the children for whom we baby\u2011sit, such as allergies or phobias (like fear of cats). Mary Anne is in charge of the record book, except for the treasury section (that\u2019s Stacey\u2019s responsibility as treasurer), and I don\u2019t think she has ever made a mistake.\n\nWe pay dues to Stacey every Monday, and we always complain. The dues go toward Claud\u2019s phone bill, gas money for Kristy\u2019s brother Charlie (who drives Kristy and Abby to our meetings), supplies for our Kid\u2011Kits, and, occasionally, club parties.\n\nKid\u2011Kits are boxes that we have each decorated and filled with lots of kid\u2011friendly items. We take the kits along on potentially difficult baby\u2011sitting assignments. For example, they\u2019re excellent icebreakers on new jobs and a big help when kids have been cooped up in the house due to bad weather or illness. Many of the games, puzzles, toys, and books once belonged to us or to our younger brothers and sisters, but we also add new art supplies and stickers as needed. The kids never notice that some of the contents of the Kid\u2011Kits are \u201crecycled.\u201d Besides, what kid can resist playing with some other kids\u2019 toys?\n\nWe also keep a club notebook, in which we write down a description of every job we go on. We are expected to read everybody else\u2019s entries. That way, we stay up\u2011to\u2011date with what is going on with our baby\u2011sitting charges. Kristy and Mallory Pike like writing in the club notebook. It\u2019s a big pain for the rest of us, but we all enjoy reading it.\n\nKristy is our president not only because of her keen organizational sense, but because the BSC was her brilliant idea. It came to her on the first Tuesday of seventh grade, as she watched her mother call one person after another, looking for a baby\u2011sitter for Kristy\u2019s younger brother. Kristy suddenly thought, What if you could dial one number and reach several reliable baby\u2011sitters?\n\nWith the help of Mary Anne, Claudia, and Stacey, Kristy soon had the club in gear. It was so successful that they had to recruit more baby\u2011sitters right away. That\u2019s when Dawn joined, followed by Logan and Shannon. Mallory and I became members when Stacey moved back to her hometown, New York City (temporarily, it turned out). Dawn also moved back home, to California, and then Abby became a member.\n\nAs you can tell by the fact that we have to keep adding new members, the club is very successful. Most of our business comes from repeat clients, and practically all of our new business is due to satisfied parents\u2019 (and children\u2019s) word\u2011of\u2011mouth.",

Everyone was trying to name some new product. And the company picked the name Mr. Pike thought up. Guess what his prize was \u2014 an all expenses\u2011paid vacation for him and his whole family. The company booked them on a special group trip \u2014 a four\u2011day cruise through the Bahama Islands and then three days at Disney World in Florida.\n\nBut this is the really exciting part. Mrs. Pike called our club to ask if Mary Anne Spier and Stacey McGill would like to go along as mother\u2019s helpers. (There are eight Pike kids.) She asked Mary Anne and Stacey because they\u2019d been mother\u2019s helpers when the Pikes took a two\u2011week trip to the Jersey shore. When my stepfather, Watson, heard about that, and then found out that I had never ever been anywhere (except in western Connecticut, visiting my cousin Robin, which was no big deal since I live in Stoneybrook, in eastern Connecticut), he did some quick planning. The next thing I knew my whole family \u2014 Mom, Watson, my big brothers Sam and Charlie, my younger brother David Michael, my little stepsister and stepbrother, Karen and Andrew, and I (Kristy Thomas) were going on the trip. And so were Claudia Kishi and Dawn Schafer, the remaining club members! They were going as our guests. Watson said he couldn\u2019t leave any members of the Baby\u2011sitters Club behind.\n\nThe trip was truly a dream come true. A plane to Florida, then off on a cruise and three days at Disney World\u2026. The Baby\u2011sitters Club never had it so good.",

Make sure you remember your knapsacks and cameras and purses.\u201d\n\nI patted my knapsack. I could feel my camera inside. It was brand\u2011new. Watson had bought it for me the week before. I couldn\u2019t wait to start using it. All my friends had brought their cameras along, too. None of us wanted to forget anything we saw.\n\n\u201cTell me again where our suitcases went,\u201d said Andrew worriedly.\n\n\u201cWe checked them,\u201d I told him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Someone will put them on the plane for us. We\u2019ll get them after we land in Florida.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Andrew, but he still looked concerned.\n\nI took Andrew and Karen by the hand then, and followed Watson to a woman in a uniform who checked the tickets, then smiled, and let us all walk by. We entered a long tunnel.\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d I asked Dawn and Claudia. They were right behind me.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the walkway to the plane,\u201d Dawn replied. \u201cI\u2019ve been on dozens of these.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt smells funny in here,\u201d said Karen, holding her nose. \u201cLike coffee, only worse.\u201d\n\nWhen we reached the plane, a flight attendant looked at the batch of tickets in Watson\u2019s hand again. Then we stepped inside.\n\n\u201cHey, Andrew! David Michael! Karen! Look in there,\u201d I cried, pointing. \u201cThat\u2019s the cockpit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a crockpit?\u201d asked Andrew.\n\n\u201cCockpit,\u201d Karen told him witheringly. \u201cIt\u2019s where the pilot sits, right, Kristy?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s where the pilot controls the plane,\u201d said David Michael. \u201cSee all those instruments?\u201d he added importantly.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d said the flight attendant to Andrew, Karen, and David Michael, \u201cyou could look around the cockpit and meet the pilot later.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d exclaimed David Michael.\n\nThe man nodded. \u201cYou might even earn your flying wings,\u201d he said mysteriously.\n\n\u201cBut at the moment,\u201d said Watson, who was way ahead of us down an aisle of the plane, \u201cyou\u2019re holding up traffic. So come find your seats.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d I said, as I took off after Watson and Mom. \u201cI didn\u2019t know planes were this big. They look so skinny from the outside.\u201d\n\nRows of nine seats were arranged across the plane, with two aisles separating them. Two seats, five seats, then two more seats. Dawn and Claudia and I sat in the middle five seats with Sam and Charlie. It would have been more fun to sit with Stacey and Mary Anne, but they were busy with the Pikes.\n\nI buckled my seat belt. Then I looked through the stuff in the pocket on the back of the seat in front of me. Emergency instructions, boring magazine, barf bag\u2026.",

Everyone was trying to name some new product. And the company picked the name Mr. Pike thought up. Guess what his prize was \u2014 an all expenses-paid vacation for him and his whole family. The company booked them on a special group trip \u2014 a four-day cruise through the Bahama Islands and then three days at Disney World in Florida. But this is the really exciting part. Mrs. Pike called our club to ask if Mary Anne Spier and Stacey McGill would like to go along as mother's helpers. (There are eight Pike kids.) She asked Mary Anne and Stacey because they'd been mother's helpers when the Pikes took a two-week trip to the Jersey shore. When my stepfather, Watson, heard about that, and then found out that I had never ever been anywhere (except in western Connecticut, visiting my cousin Robin, which was no big deal since I live in Stoneybrook, in eastern Connecticut), he did some quick planning. The next thing I knew my whole family \u2014 Mom, Watson, my big brothers Sam and Charlie, my younger brother David Michael, my little stepsister and stepbrother, Karen and Andrew, and I (Kristy Thomas) were going on the trip. And so were Claudia Kishi and Dawn Schafer, the remaining club members! They were going as our guests. Watson said he couldn't leave any members of the Baby-sitters Club behind.\"\n\nThe trip was truly a dream come true. A plane to Florida, then off on a cruise and three days at Disney World....

          "text": "I\u2019ll never understand. How did this happen?\n\nI, Stacey McGill, am a New York City girl. I love the feel of concrete under my feet. I love the sight of tall buildings. I especially love the sight of a really prime department store, such as Bloomingdale\u2019s. Grass and trees and lakes? I can take them or leave them. Or I can visit Central Park. So how did I wind up going to Camp Mohawk as a counselor-in-training for two weeks? Well, it had to do with my friends in Connecticut. I lived in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, for a year, and right after I moved there, I joined a group called the Baby\u2011sitters Club. The girls in the club became my friends, and we stayed friends after my parents and I moved back to New York.\n\nOne day I received a letter from my friends saying that they\u2019d decided to go to Camp Mohawk as CITs for two weeks. They said being a CIT is better than being a camper or a counselor because you get all the fun of being a camper, plus extra privileges, and all the privileges of being a counselor, plus extra fun. Then they said, wouldn\u2019t I like to be a CIT at Camp Mohawk for two weeks, too?\n\nI wrote back and said NO! I told them all the stuff about concrete and tall buildings and Bloomingdale\u2019s and Central Park. They wrote back and said, But Stacey, it\u2019s only for two weeks. I wrote back and said, So what? This went on for quite awhile, until finally they convinced me to go. Anyway, how could I miss out on something the rest of the club was going to do? I couldn\u2019t. So I gave in.\n\nI decided to do something special, though. I decided that if I was going to make this supreme effort \u2014 if I was going to give up two weeks of a perfectly good summer plus Bloomingdale\u2019s and my baby\u2011sitting jobs in New York and all the rest \u2014 then I wanted some sort of a record of my adventure in the woods. I was going to keep a notebook about the two weeks at Camp Mohawk, and make all my friends write in it, too. When it was finished, it would be my book. We would all write in it, but the book would be mine. Of course, I would let the others read it any time they wanted.\n\nSo here is Chapter One. I get to write the first chapter because the book is my idea and I\u2019m bringing the notebook to camp with me from New York, and besides, none of the other club members knows about it yet. They will soon, though. Since the start of the Baby\u2011sitters Club, Kristy has made the rest of us write up every single sitting job we ever went on. There\u2019s a huge fat notebook full of our experiences. Kristy could order us to do something like this because she\u2019s the club president, the boss. Now it is my turn to be the boss.",

          "text": "So. Here I am at Camp Mohawk.\n\nAt nine o\u2019clock this morning, a whole flock of campers, counselors, CITs, and junior CITs gathered in front of a building on 34th Street near Park Avenue. It was the meeting spot for anyone in Manhattan going upstate to Camp Mohawk.\n\nYou should have been there. I will never forget that scene. It was a mob of parents, and of kids ages six to twenty. (Well, the twenty\u2011year\u2011olds were the counselors, and they weren\u2019t exactly kids.) Half the people in the crowd were crying. That half was the parents. Also a few of the youngest kids were crying. They were saying things like, \u201cIs my teddy really going to be okay smushed into my suitcase for three hours?\u201d and \u201cWhat if they make me eat turnips at camp?\u201d\n\nThe parents were saying things like, \u201cOh, my baby. Going away for two entire weeks. You\u2019re growing up so fast. You\u2019ll probably come back taller than I am.\u201d (And hopefully smarter, I thought.)\n\nMy own personal mother was saying, \u201cOh, my baby. Going away for two entire weeks. You\u2019re growing up so fast. What am I going to do while you\u2019re gone?\u201d\n\nShe dabbed at her eyes with a soggy Kleenex.\n\n\u201cYou could go to Bloomingdale\u2019s,\u201d I suggested.\n\nMy father laughed. \u201cShe could move into Bloomingdale\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThen we all laughed.\n\nWhile the laughing and crying were going on, the counselors had been loading suitcases and sleeping bags and knapsacks into the luggage compartments under two buses parked at the curb. Since most of us would be gone for only two weeks, not the whole summer, we didn\u2019t need to pack up trunks and a ton of other stuff. Only four kids did. Anyway, it barely mattered what we packed in, because in everybody\u2019s suitcase were the same things: about three hundred pairs each of Camp Mohawk T\u2011shirts, shorts, socks, sweaters, and nightshirts. (We were allowed to wear our own underwear and sneakers, thank goodness.) And on every article of clothing, including the socks, was this symbol:\n\n\n\nA teepee. Now, I don\u2019t know a lot about Native American culture, but I know this much. The Mohawk Indians are part of the large Iroquois nation. And the Iroquois Indians lived in longhouses, not teepees.\n\nBut what can you do? This was camp, not school.\n\nBy the time all that Camp Mohawk stuff had been stowed under the buses, the laughing and crying had pretty much stopped. Everyone was running out of things to say. But as soon as one of the counselors shouted, \u201cOkay, all aboard!\u201d the talking and the good\u2011byes began again.\n\n\u201cEat all your vegetables,\u201d one father said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to feed my goldfish!\u201d called out a little girl.\n\n\u201cAre you sure my teddy won\u2019t suffocate in the suitcase?\u201d asked the worried\u2011looking boy.\n\n\u201cBloomingdale\u2019s won\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d That was Mom.\n\n\u201cRight. It\u2019ll go broke.\u201d That was Dad.\n\nThis was getting embarrassing. So I hugged my parents and joined the line of kids that was streaming onto one of the buses. As I climbed the steps, I turned around to wave at Mom and Dad.\n\n\u201cGood\u2011bye! Watch what you eat!\u201d they called. And my mother added, \u201cHave fun and be careful!\u201d\n\nIt never, never, never, never, ever fails. Mom says, \u201cHave fun and be careful,\u201d each time we say good\u2011bye in New York. She is neurotic about it.\n\nAs nervous as I was about stepping onto a bus full of strangers, I did just that. While I was doing so I wondered, on an embarrassment scale of one to ten, just how bad \u201cWatc",

          "text": "Thank goodness we were still going to the lodge. I\u2019d have died if I couldn\u2019t have finished my book for Logan. By Sunday, he had already left for Aruba, and if our trip had been canceled, not only would we have to go to school instead of to the lodge, but the week would have seemed a year long without him. In Vermont I\u2019d be distracted by all the new things to do. In Connecticut, I would just have moped around. Of course, the best thing would have been if Logan could have come to Vermont with us. (He\u2019s never even been on the trip because his family still lived in Kentucky last year.) But you can\u2019t have everything.\n\nAnyway, by Sunday night the rumor had been cleared up (or put to rest, as my father would say), so despite the overcast sky and the light snow that was falling, I went to bed knowing the trip was still on.\n\nThe trip really is a pretty amazing thing. I don\u2019t think kids in many middle schools do what we get to do every year \u2014 go away for almost a week at practically no cost. Our parents are just asked to make a donation to the Winter Carnival Fund. If we don\u2019t earn enough money, then the Leicester Lodge people cover whatever isn\u2019t raised. A nice (rich) couple owns the lodge, and they do this for lots of schools all winter long, just so students can have an away\u2011from\u2011home experience. It\u2019s something they like to do for kids. And, boy, do they make our experience nice. Several wings of their huge lodge are equipped as fancy dormitories. (Usually, more than one school is at the lodge at the same time, which is fun because you get to meet new people.) And all week long, they feed us terrific food, and let us use the lodge along with the skiers and other people who are vacationing there. They don\u2019t even mind our Winter War.",

          "text": "Before I get too much further along, I better stop and tell you who I am. I\u2019m Mary Anne Spier. I\u2019m thirteen and I\u2019m in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School (SMS). I don\u2019t have any brothers or sisters, just an adorable gray kitten named Tigger. I don\u2019t have a mom, either, but I do have a pretty nice dad. We live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, and I have a lot of friends here. Most of them are my friends in the Baby\u2011Sitters Club. Plus, there\u2019s Logan (who\u2019s also part of the club). He\u2019s my boyfriend. It was a long time before I felt brave enough to call him that, but that\u2019s what he is.\n\nMy friends in the Baby\u2011Sitters Club are Kristy Thomas, Dawn Schafer, Claudia Kishi, Stacey McGill, Jessi Ramsey, and Mallory Pike. They were all going on the trip, too. For weeks, the seven of us had been so excited we could hardly say the words \u201cWinter Carnival\u201d without becoming hysterical. Five of us had been on the trip before, but Mal and Jessi hadn\u2019t, since they\u2019re in sixth grade. It would be their first time.\n\nKristy and Dawn are my two best friends. Kristy is outgoing and has a big mouth, but I don\u2019t mind her mouth \u2014 much. She\u2019s funny and full of good ideas. She comes from a huge, mixed\u2011up family with brothers, a stepbrother and stepsister, and even an adopted sister. Dawn is an individual. She has somehow learned not to care about what people think, and to just go her own way and do what she wants to do, without hurting anyone\u2019s feelings. Dawn has one brother, who lives in California with her father. (Her parents are divorced.)\n\nClaudia and Stacey are best friends, but not my best friends, although we\u2019re all pretty close. They\u2019re both wild dressers, and definitely the most sophisticated of the club members. Stacey even grew up in New York City. One thing you should know about Stacey is that she has diabetes, but she copes really well. Claudia is an artist and a junk\u2011food addict. Stacey\u2019s parents are in the middle of a divorce; Claudia\u2019s aren\u2019t. Stacey is an only child; Claud has an older sister named Janine.\n\nThen there are Jessi and Mal who, by Sunday night, were getting nervous about the trip to the lodge. It wasn\u2019t their first time away from home (we all went to Camp Mohawk for two weeks in the summer), but the sixth\u2011graders are always the \u201cbabies\u201d of the trip, going away with the \u201cbig kids,\u201d and that\u2019s not an easy position to be in. Anyway, Jessi and Mal are also best friends, and they\u2019re big readers, but that\u2019s where the similarities end. Mal wants to be a writer when she grows up; Jessi is a talented ballet dancer. Mal has seven younger brothers and sisters; Jessi has two. Also, Mal is white and Jessi is black.\n\nThose are my friends, and I was glad they were all going on the trip with me. (I would have been even happier if Logan were going, though.) At least the trip hadn\u2019t been called off. I have to admit that I was kind of surprised by that.",

Instead, I just brushed my teeth and then picked up Tigger. All I had to do was look into those shiny eyes of his and I wanted to cry. I could feel a huge lump in my throat.\n\n\u201cMew?\u201d said Tigger.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back on Saturday,\"\n",

I\u2019m going to beat the pants off you!\\\" replied Claudia.\\n\\nWe were on the phone, and we had challenged each other to a sailing race, which would be held the next day.\\n\\n\\\"No, you\u2019re not. I did tons of sailing with Dad and Jeff when I lived in California. And we go sailing almost every time I visit them now.\\\" \\n\\nMy parents are divorced. Mom and I live here in Stoneybrook, and Dad and Jeff live in California. Why? That\u2019s a long story. To make it short, let me just say that Mom grew up in Stoneybrook, but she met my father in California, where he\u2019d grown up. After the divorce, it seemed natural for Mom to return to Connecticut with Jeff and me. But Jeff never adjusted to things here, so he went back to Dad and California, where he\u2019d always been happy. I visit them whenever I can.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I sail every summer when we go away on vacation,\\\" said Claudia. \\\"Face it. You and I are pretty evenly matched. We\u2019ve been taking lessons from the same instructors for two months now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You\u2019re right. Tomorrow will be a close race\u2026. But I\u2019m still going to beat you!\\\" I replied.\\n\\n\\\"I wish the instructors would let us race to Greenpoint without counselors along,\\\" said Claudia. \\\"I don\u2019t want the counselors anymore.\\\" (Greenpoint is an island off the coast where the community center often holds special events.)\\n\\n\\\"I don\u2019t want the counselors, either. They\u2019re nice, but having them along is kind of a drag. It\u2019s like going clothes shopping with your parents.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Besides, we\u2019ve sailed to Greenpoint a million times.\\\" (That was an exaggeration, naturally.)\\n\\n\\\"I know,\\\" I said.\\n\\n\\\"I guess they\u2019re afraid we\u2019ll go off course. There are an awful lot of teeny, tiny islands all up and down the coast.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Really?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sure.\\\" (Claud knows Connecticut much better than I do, since she grew up here and I\u2019m a recent transplant.) \\\"Some of them are so small that people own them. Imagine owning an island. They look like pinpricks from up in an airplane. There must be hundreds of them.\\\" (This time, I knew Claud was not exaggerating.)\\n\\n\\\"Wow,\\\" I said.\\n\\n\\\"Anyway, get ready for Greenpoint,\\\" said Claud. \\\"I\u2019m going to bed now. I want to rest up for the big race.\\\"\\n\\nRest up. Ha! Claud just wanted a chance to go to bed early. She likes to get under the covers with a good Nancy Drew mystery. And, possibly, a candy bar.\\n\\nI, on the other hand, was going to exercise, bulk up on some pasta, and get a normal amount of sleep. That was the way to win the race \u2014 wasn\u2019t it?",

I didn\u2019t know there was that much money in the whole world, let alone in Connecticut.\n\nMy friend Claudia had been giving her father money to buy her a lottery ticket each week practically forever (kids can\u2019t buy the tickets themselves, which is incredibly unfair), but she never won anything, so my other friends and I were always teasing her. But when the jackpot reached 23 million dollars, the seven of us \u2014 Mary Anne Spier, Kristy Thomas, Jessi Ramsey, Stacey McGill, Mallory Pike, Claudia Kishi, and me, Dawn Schafer \u2014 chipped in enough money to buy seven tickets. We asked my mom to get the tickets for us, and we agreed that if any of the tickets was a winner, we would split the money seven ways, which would be over three million dollars apiece. At that rate, we figured we could be women of leisure all our lives.\n\nSo anyway, on the day of the drawing, we gave my mom our money and she bought us seven tickets. It was a Friday. The winning number would be drawn that night. With seven tickets, we were so sure we were going to win that we had a sleepover at my house just to watch the news. Promptly at 9:59 we gathered in front of the TV for the Ten O\u2019Clock Report. The Jack-O\u2019-Lottery drawing wasn\u2019t held until 10:25 and I can\u2019t say we were very patient. At one point, Kristy actually said, \"Oh, who cares about world peace? When are they going to announce the winning ticket?\"\n\nAnyway, the newscaster finally got around to the jackpot. \"And the winning number is \u2026 fifty-three \u2026\"\n\n\"Yes!\" I shouted, looking at the ticket I was holding.\n\n\"Twenty-seven \u2026 thirteen \u2026 eight \u2026 seventy-one \u2026\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes, YES!\" I couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\n\"Are you kidding, Dawn?\" asked Mary Anne, who\u2019s my stepsister.\n\n\"Shh. No.\"\n\n\"And the final number,\" said the announcer, \"is eleven.\"\n\n\"Eleven?\" I cried. \"No, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s thirty-five.\" I almost burst into tears.\n\n\"Wait a sec,\" said Claud. \"Your ticket has five of the six winning numbers?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied.\n\n\"Then we\u2019ve won a prize!\"",

          "text": "What is the BSC? Well, it\u2019s a business that my six friends and I run. It was Kristy\u2019s idea. She thought it up at the beginning of seventh grade. (Kristy, Stacey, Mary Anne, Claudia, and I are all thirteen now, and in eighth grade. Mallory and Jessi are eleven and in sixth grade. We go to Stoneybrook Middle School.) Anyway, Kristy\u2019s idea was for a group of her friends who baby-sit to get together several times a week and hold meetings. People who needed sitters could call us during the meetings. Since they would reach a bunch of sitters, they\u2019d almost be guaranteed to find somebody available \u2014 instead of making call after call to sitters who might not be at home.\n\nWell, the club was a success from the beginning. It started with just four girls, and now there are the seven of us, plus two associate members. (The associate members don\u2019t come to meetings, but they are reliable sitters whom we can call on for help if a job comes in that none of us can take. Guess who the associate members are \u2014 a friend of Kristy\u2019s named Shannon Kilbourne \u2026 and Logan Bruno, who is Mary Anne\u2019s boyfriend!)\n\nAnyway, the club is run very efficiently, and I think that\u2019s one reason it\u2019s such a big success. Kristy runs the club because she\u2019s the president. And she\u2019s the president because the club was her idea in the first place, and also because she\u2019s always getting more good ideas for the club. She makes us keep a notebook in which we write up our baby\u2011sitting experiences, and she thinks up ways to advertise the club so that we get more clients.\n\nKristy comes from an interesting family. There\u2019s her mom; her stepfather, Watson, (her biological father walked out on her family when Kristy was about six); her two older brothers, Charlie and Sam; her little brother, David Michael; her stepbrother and stepsister, Andrew and Karen, who are four and seven; her grandmother, Nannie; and her adopted sister, Emily Michelle. Emily is two and a half. She came from Vietnam. Kristy and her happy, jumbled\u2011up family live in a mansion in a different part of Stoneybrook than where the rest of us live (Karen and Andrew only live there some of the time; they live mainly with their mother and stepfather). The mansion is Watson\u2019s. It\u2019s his family home and he grew up there. But Kristy has only lived there since the summer before eighth",

While we\u2019re meeting (in my room \u2014 club headquarters), parents call and line up sitters for their kids.

          "text": "Now we would soon be off on another trip. To New York City. The home of museums, theaters, the Hard Rock Cafe, Bloomingdale\u2019s, the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, Macy\u2019s, South Street Seaport, Lord and Taylor, Madison Square Garden, Saks Fifth Avenue, and HIM. McKenzie Clarke.\n\nEven though it was only Wednesday, and the BSC members wouldn\u2019t be leaving on their wonderful two\u2011week trip until Saturday, I had started packing. My suitcase was open on my bed. And already it was as cluttered and messy as my room usually is. Except that my room is cluttered with art supplies \u2014 paper, paints, pastels, canvases, an easel, and boxes of \u201cstuff.\u201d\n\nMy mother says I am a pack rat. So what? Pack rats are probably very nice animals. And I bet they\u2019re prepared for anything. I know I am.\n\nAnyway, my suitcase was cluttered with about three years\u2019 worth of clothing, and a whole pile of things that I couldn\u2019t decide whether to pack. Would I need suntan lotion and three bathing suits? Probably not. I took them out and dropped them on the floor. Then I began weeding out articles of clothing, entire outfits. I wondered if my other friends were having as hard a time packing as I was. We had all decided to pack that afternoon. Then we were going to ask Stacey her opinion of the things we were bringing. (Stacey is a New York expert, since she grew up there.) We figured that if Stacey said we\u2019d made any horrible packing boo\u2011boos, we\u2019d have almost three days to straighten them out before we left on our trip.\n\nStacey, I knew, would be methodically placing just the right things in her suitcase. Since she\u2019s a little wild, her clothing would be sophisticated and extremely chilly. (My friends and I now say that something is \u201cchilly\u201d when it\u2019s really, really cool.) Stacey would be packing black leggings (some with stirrups on the feet, some without) and baggy black and white and red tops. She would probably pack or wear her black cowboy boots. Stacey and I both look good in black and white. Stace\u2019s hair is blonde and curly, usually as the result of a perm (the curliness, I mean; not its color). Her eyes are a deep blue, and she has neat dimples when she smiles. Stacey wears very chilly jewelry (so do I; we both have pierced ears), and she loves to do things that make herself look a little unusual. She might sprinkle glitter in her hair, or paint her nails silver.",

Then, just before seventh grade started, the McGills moved here. Mr. McGill\u2019s company had transferred him to their offices in Stamford, which is not far from Stoneybrook. The McGills had been in Connecticut for only about a year, when Mr. McGill was transferred back to New York. (I cried a lot when my new best friend moved away.) But once they were in the city again, Mr. and Mrs. McGill began arguing and fighting. They decided to get a divorce. And Stacey\u2019s mom decided to move back to Connecticut, while Mr. McGill stayed in New York with his job. Now Stacey lives in Stoneybrook again, but she visits her dad pretty often.\n\nSound like a tough life? Well, that\u2019s not all. Stacey has a disease called diabetes. She happens to have a severe form of it, and she\u2019s been pretty sick a few times. (Stacey is well acquainted with hospitals.) She can control her diabetes partly by sticking to a strict, calorie\u2011counting diet, which allows her no candy or desserts. Poor thing. I, personally, am addicted to candy and junk food. Stacey also has to give herself injections (ew!) of something called insulin. I hope she stays healthy. I don\u2019t want her to land in the hospital again.",

Kristy has never been one to dress up, and she has not always been rich. Until the summer before eighth grade, Kristy lived right across the street from me in a little house with her mom and her three brothers. (Mr. Thomas walked out on his family when Kristy was about six.) But then Mrs. Thomas married Watson the millionaire. Watson moved the Thomases across town to his mansion. So now Kristy lives in this ritzy house with her new family, which includes (aside from her mother and brothers) her adopted sister, Emily; her grandmother; her stepbrother and stepsister (only sometimes); and a cat, a dog, and some fish.\n\nKristy\u2019s life may have changed, but her taste hasn\u2019t.

This is a letter about a newspaper article, not the Baby-sitters Club.\u201d\n\nMy best friend, Mary Anne Spier, is far too practical. I didn\u2019t think an announcement about our business could hurt anything. Even so, I took out the P.P.S. It wasn\u2019t worth arguing over.\n\nBoy, you will never believe what happened to me and my friends in the Baby-sitters Club (BSC) when a huge blizzard hit our little town of Stoneybrook, Connecticut, last week. The storm caught everyone by surprise, and different things happened to all of us. Some of our adventures were scary, some were exciting \u2026 and mine was funny! Most of us were separated during the storm. We were also out of touch, because after awhile, the phone lines went down. (Also, the power went out.) So we didn\u2019t hear about the adventures until the next day, when we could gab on the phone again.\n\nConsidering how fascinating our experiences were, I was surprised to read the article headed \u201cBlizzard\u201d in the paper the next day. I know I told the editor, Marian Tan, that the article was very informative (and it was), but the truth is, it was also an incredible bore. It mentioned lots of facts and statistics. For instance, about 28 inches of snow fell in Stoneybrook, and there was this windchill factor of minus 8 degrees. But the article didn\u2019t say anything about people. There was no human interest. What about the cars that got stranded (I mean, with people in them)? What about parents who had left their kids with baby-sitters and couldn\u2019t get home to them? And what about people who got stuck at airports?\n\nI decided that my article would give people the kind of news they wanted. Interesting news. If only Marian Tan would print it.",

          "text": "\u201cKristy, can you please help me with my sweater?\u201d\n\nI turned around. I was sitting at the desk in my room, slaving over a math problem. Since I was nowhere near solving it, I didn\u2019t mind the interruption. My stepsister, Karen, was standing in the doorway.\n\n\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake. Why are you wearing your sweater on your legs?\u201d I asked. Karen had put each of her feet through a sleeve of her sweater and was now struggling to hold the bottom of the sweater around her waist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new style,\u201d Karen replied. \u201cSweater-pants.\u201d She hobbled over to my desk. \u201cCan you button me up the back, please?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a feeling,\u201d I said as I fastened the buttons, \u201cthat this isn\u2019t what Nannie had in mind when she knitted this sweater for you.\u201d\n\nNannie is my grandmother. She and Karen are just two of the people in my big, jumbly family. The others are my mom; my stepfather, Watson; my three brothers (Charlie, who\u2019s seventeen; Sam, who\u2019s fifteen; and David Michael, who\u2019s seven); my stepbrother, Andrew (he\u2019s four and Karen is seven); and my adopted sister, Emily Michelle. Emily is two and a half. Mom and Watson adopted her from Vietnam. I don\u2019t really think of her as my adopted sister. She\u2019s just my sister, the same as Karen and Andrew are just my sister and brother.\n\nThat\u2019s a big family, right? Nannie is Mom\u2019s mother. She helps care for Emily while Mom and Watson are at work. Karen and Andrew are Watson\u2019s kids from his first marriage. Usually, they live with us every other weekend, but this December they were living with us for two weeks while their mom and stepfather went on a ski vacation. (Karen and Andrew\u2019s other house is right here in Stoneybrook, not far from their father\u2019s house.) They had arrived yesterday. When Karen is here, things are never dull.\n\nKaren pranced out of my room, wearing her sweater-pants.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d I asked her.\n\n\u201cPlay with Emily Junior.\u201d (Emily is Karen\u2019s rat. Karen named her after Emily Michelle. I think that was a compliment.)\n\nI turned back to my homework, but those numbers and signs sort of swam around on the paper. I let my mind wander. It wandered right to the Winter Wonderland Dance. It was going to be held on Friday evening after school, and it would be a pretty big deal. It was for every student at SMS \u2014 sixth-graders, seventh-graders, and eighth-graders. For once, every single one of my friends and I had a date for the dance. We planned to attend together, seven girls and seven boys. We couldn\u2019t wait. The decorating committee was going to transform the SMS gym into a snowy fairyland \u2014 sparkly flakes and white cotton\u2011drifts, tinsel icicles. It would be awesome.\n\nIn the past, I have not thought much about dances, but now they\u2019re a little more meaningful. This is because I have a friend. I mean, a friend who\u2019s a boy. Oh, all right. He\u2019s my boyfriend. I guess. I never thought I would have a boyfriend. My friends say I\u2019m a tomboy, and I suppose that\u2019s true. I love sports. I\u2019m happiest wearing jeans and running shoes. Basically, I think makeup is a waste of time. And jewelry? I can take it or leave it. I don\u2019t even have pierced ears.\n\nHowever, I met Bart.\n\nEverything changed. No, that\u2019s not true. Bart and I met because we each coach a softball team for little kids. So our friendship is founded on sports. Also, I would still rather wear blue jeans than a dress. And I don\u2019t plan to get my ears pierced. But \u2026 I look forward to spending time with Bart. And I was particularly looking forward to going to the Winter Wonderland Dance with him. I was even looking forward to wearing a dress (since I would only be in it for a few hours). Plus, going to a dance with all of my friends and all of their dates would be really fun. Mary Anne and I had been talking about the event for weeks. We planned to buy carnations for our dates. (We had a feeling they might be buying corsages for us.)",

(He\u2019s my oldest brother.)\n\n\"How come we never heard about this cabin before?\" asked Sam. (He\u2019s my next oldest brother.)\n\n\"Why is it called Shadow Lake?\" asked Karen. (She\u2019s my stepsister.) \"That sounds spooky.\"\n\nWatson had called a family meeting. It was a summery Friday evening, and my entire family had gathered in our backyard. Most of us were sitting on the grass. The others were sitting on lounge chairs.\n\nMy family is on the large side. Not size-wise, numbers-wise. There are ten of us: Mom; Watson; Nannie (Mom\u2019s mother); Charlie and Sam, who are seventeen and fifteen; my younger brother, David Michael, who\u2019s almost eight; Karen, who\u2019s seven; Andrew, my stepbrother, who\u2019s four; Emily Michelle, my adopted sister (she\u2019s two and a half, and she came from Vietnam); and me. I am Kristy Thomas. My full name is Kristin Amanda Thomas. I\u2019m thirteen, and I\u2019m an eighth\u2011grader at Stoneybrook Middle School here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut.\n\n\nWatson tried to answer the questions we were throwing at him. \"I don\u2019t know yet if we\u2019re going to Shadow Lake,\" he said to Charlie. \"That\u2019s mostly why I called this meeting. To decide.\"\n\nHe turned to Karen. (Karen is his daughter from his first marriage. Karen and Andrew also live in Stoneybrook, but mostly with their mother. Every other weekend, and on some holidays and vacations they live with us, though. It is a good thing Watson\u2019s house is actually a mansion, with plenty of room for everyone.) \"I\u2019m not sure how Shadow Lake got its name, Karen,\" Watson continued. \"But there\u2019s nothing scary about the place, so you don\u2019t have to worry.\"\n\n\"Where is Shadow Lake, honey?\" asked my mother.\n\n\"In the mountains of western Massachusetts. One of the most beautiful places I\u2019ve ever seen. Anyway, that\u2019s what I thought when I was twelve. I haven\u2019t been there since. Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t seen Aunt Faith and Uncle Pierson in almost twenty years. Not since I was a very young man.\"\n\n\"What\u2019s the cabin like?\" Nannie wanted to know.\n\n\"It\u2019s like a house,\" answered Watson, smiling. \"I mean, it\u2019s large. If I remember correctly, it must be able to sleep twenty\u2011five people. Maybe more. Two of the bedrooms are like dorms. Wall\u2011to\u2011wall bunk beds. The cabin sits right on the shore of the lake. A porch runs all the way around the cabin, and the place is surrounded by trees. It\u2019s really something.\"\n\n\"Oh, Watson, please. You have to let your aunt and uncle leave the cabin to you!\" I exclaimed.\n\nWatson looked serious. \"I don\u2019t know. It is a big responsibility. But a visit there might help make up my mind. How would you feel about spending two weeks at the cabin this summer? When Karen and Andrew can come with us?\"\n\nI don\u2019t think I need to tell you what we thought of that idea. My brothers and sisters and I cheered, and Karen raised her fists and hissed, \"Yes!\" Then she added, \"Can we invite friends?\"\n\n\"Friends?\" repeated Watson. \"I hadn\u2019t thought about that.\" He glanced at Mom, and they held a silent discussion with their eyes. \"Sure. You can invite some friends,\" said Watson finally. \"Within reason.\" (More cheering.) \"Keep in mind, though, that taking this vacation does not mean we\u2019re taking the cabin\" were Watson\u2019s last words at that fateful Friday family meeting.",

          "text": "Well, we would see about that, I thought. I was already thinking of ways to convince Watson to take the cabin. I was positive Shadow Lake was a wonderful place. So I decided to keep a diary of our trip. After the trip, I would give the diary to Watson to remind him of our fabulous vacation. And of how much we loved the cabin.\n\nThat was the first entry in my trip diary. I intended to sound as enthusiastic and as positive as possible. I also intended to ask my brothers and sisters and friends to write in the diary as well, so that Watson would know I wasn\u2019t the only one having fun at the cabin on Shadow Lake.\n\nWait till you hear who was coming along on our vacation. Twenty people. (And I thought my family was big.) David Michael, Karen, and I had invited ten friends among us. (Charlie and Sam weren\u2019t interested in asking friends. They just wanted to \u201cscope out the chicks at the lake\u201d \u2014 in Charlie\u2019s words. And concentrate on water sports. And Andrew and Emily are too little to invite friends. I mean, too young. Actually, I mean their friends are too young to come on a vacation with someone else\u2019s family.)\n\nAnyway, Karen had invited her two best friends, Nancy Dawes and Hannie Papadakis. The girls are in the same class in school. They call themselves the Three Musketeers. David Michael had also invited two of his good friends, Nicky Pike and Linny Papadakis. (In case you\u2019re wondering, Linny is Hannie\u2019s older brother.) However, unlike the Three Musketeers, who are best friends, Linny and Nicky barely knew each other at all before the trip.\n\nAlso in case you\u2019re wondering, yes I invited six friends to come on the trip to Shadow Lake. How did I get away with that? Well, my friends and I offered to baby\u2011sit free of charge for the little kids, all eight of them, during the vacation. And Mom and Watson took us up on the offer. They know my friends and I are good sitters. After all, we run a business called the Baby\u2011sitters Club.",

But I didn\u2019t say mine was perfect. I said it was wonderful. And it is \u2014 when I ignore the not-so-wonderful parts \u2014 like the fact that I am one of the few African-American kids in my school (for that matter, in my town), which sometimes is not easy.\n\nBut I figure I\u2019ve more than made up for the difficult and sad times with all that wonderful stuff. For instance, I have a wonderful family. I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, with my mother and father, my younger sister Becca (she\u2019s eight; I\u2019m eleven), and our baby brother Squirt. (His real name is John Philip Ramsey, Junior.) The sixth member of my family is Aunt Cecelia, Daddy\u2019s sister. Sometimes she\u2019s a pain, but mostly she\u2019s okay.\n\nI have wonderful friends; six, as a matter of fact. They are the members of the Baby-sitters Club, or the BSC. (I\u2019ll tell you about that later.) And one of them is my best friend, Mallory Pike. Mal is eleven and in sixth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School (SMS) with me.\n\nAnd I\u2019m involved in some wonderful activities. As you might expect, I baby-sit. A lot. (What else would a member of something called the Baby-sitters Club do?) Then there\u2019s ballet. Ballet is my passion. I have studied for years, and I take classes at a special dance school in Stamford, which is the nearest big city to little Stoneybrook. I had to audition just to get into the school. Not to brag, but I have earned leading roles in several of the productions put on by my school. I have danced in lots of ballets. My teacher, Mme Noelle, tells me, \u201cWork hard and zen harder, and someday I sink you weel donce wiss a major ballet company.\u201d (Mme Noelle speaks with a French accent, in case you couldn\u2019t tell.)",

First, I learned that I had been chosen as the sixth-grade correspondent for the SMS Express, our school newspaper. When I first thought about writing for the paper, Mama said to me, \u201cJessi, you\u2019re going to over-extend yourself.\u201d (My real name is Jessica, but hardly anyone ever calls me that.) I thought about what Mama said. I was already pretty busy, what with dance classes and baby-sitting and schoolwork. Then I pictured myself over-extended, my body like rubber, my arms and legs and head stretching out wildly in five directions. And then I talked to Emily Bernstein, who\u2019s the student editor of the SMS Express. Emily told me that each correspondent is responsible for just one article a month, a round-up of student activities. I decided I could handle that, so I submitted some writing samples to Emily, and today she told me I had officially been named the sixth-grade correspondent.",

          "text": "Well, as if that weren\u2019t enough wonderfulness, guess what I found out about five minutes after I heard Emily\u2019s news? I was walking to the cafeteria and on a wall in the hallway I saw a poster announcing that SMS \u2014 my very own school \u2014 was going to be putting on a musical extravaganza, Peter Pan. Anyone could try out for any role. The date of the auditions was to be announced.\n\nAll right! This was awesome! Peter Pan would be my chance to shine in front of all the kids at SMS. My friends in the BSC had seen me in performances at my dance school, but the other kids hadn\u2019t. Now I could show everyone what I can do. I could show them the real Jessi Ramsey. Plus, I was just perfect for the part of Peter Pan. For one thing, that part is usually played by a female. For another, Peter Pan has to be able to dance (not to mention fly), and I had plenty of stage experience.\n\nI was so excited about being the sixth-grade correspondent and Peter Pan, that a fabulous idea sprang into my mind. I decided to ask Emily if I could write a special article about the play for the SMS Express. I would cover the extravaganza from start to finish as an insider. I would write about auditions, rehearsals, and opening night. I would write about the hopes and dreams of the cast members. I could be an on-the-spot reporter.\n\nEven though I was on my way to the cafeteria for lunch, I suddenly decided I was too excited to eat.",

Then I dashed to the library, sat down at an empty table, opened the notebook, and began scribbling ideas for my article. Even at that early stage I felt bad for the kids who were going to audition for the role of Peter Pan and lose out, but I tried not to worry about them. Maybe they would even make a good angle for the article.

The thing is, I really like school. And I work hard and do well (most of the time). Usually, I leave class like a normal person, not a racehorse. But on that day I couldn\u2019t wait to catch up with my friends and talk to them about Peter Pan. Oh, and tell them about my new job on the SMS Express.\n\nI tore through the hallways, dodging kids like a football player, and approached my locker so fast I nearly crashed into it.\n\n\u201cJessi!\u201d exclaimed a voice. \u201cWhere were you at lunch today?\u201d\n\nMallory Pike was standing next to my locker, looking worried.\n\n\u201cOh, in the library,\u201d I answered. \u201cI was too excited to eat.

But it doesn\u2019t have the same \u2026 burst of flavor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ingredients are definitely inferior,\u201d Logan Bruno added.\n\nWe sat, chewing thoughtfully, saying nothing. We looked like nine cows in a pasture.\n\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s vote,\u201d Claudia said. \u201cAll those in favor of Sample A, raise your hands\u2026. Sample B?\u201d\n\nNo, we were not having some gourmet food sampling. It was minutes before our Friday Baby\u2011sitters Club meeting, and Claudia was conducting an End\u2011of\u2011the\u2011Season Junk Food Blind Taste\u2011Off. We were to decide which tasted better, Heath Bars or Skor Bars. She had bought several of each and removed the wrappers so we wouldn\u2019t know which we were eating.\n\nStrange, huh? That\u2019s Claudia. She\u2019s the BSC\u2019s resident junk food addict. Her bedroom (our official headquarters) is crammed full of candy, chips, and pretzels. And it\u2019s all well hidden, because her parents are firm believers in Good Nutrition. (They\u2019re also believers in Fine Literature, which is why Claudia has also tucked her Nancy Drew books in among her socks and underwear.)\n\nClaud is a talented artist, sculptor, and jewelry\u2011maker. Mr. and Mrs. Kishi approve of those things, so Claud keeps her supplies in full view. Which is how she prevents her parents from finding her hidden stuff. She tells them no one\u2019s allowed to touch her works in progress \u2014 which occupy every corner of the room.\n\nYou can probably picture the place. It\u2019s a pigsty. (Sorry, but it is.) Us BSCers put up with it, though. One, because we love Claud. And two, because she\u2019s the only one of us who has her own private phone with a private phone number. (The phone is crucial to the success of our business.)",

We have seven members (nine, if you count our associates). So our clients know they can book a reliable, expert sitter with just one call.\n\nThe BSC was an idea waiting to happen. (I read that expression somewhere, and it really fits.) Actually, it was my idea. I thought of it awhile ago when my mom was having trouble lining up a sitter. And it has really worked. Now we have tons of regular clients. We keep them, too, because we\u2019re a well\u2011run organization (also because we happen to be nice and charming and responsible).\n\nLike any company, we have officers and rules and record\u2011keeping.

I\u2019d probably just mess them up, anyway.\n\nMy stepdad, by the way, is named Watson Brewer. My mom married him a year or so ago. (My father walked out on our family when I was seven. It\u2019s something I don\u2019t like to talk about.) Watson must really love kids, because when he married her, he got me and my three brothers in the bargain. (Charlie\u2019s seventeen, Sam\u2019s fifteen, and David Michael\u2019s seven.) Plus he has two kids from a previous marriage, named Karen and Andrew, who live with him every other weekend. Then, to top it all off, Mom and Watson adopted a little Vietnamese girl named Emily Michelle (who just happens to be the cutest child in the universe). Then my grandmother moved in to help out. Now that\u2019s a big family. Not that space is a problem. Our house is this huge old mansion way on the other side of town.

People say we look a little alike (we\u2019re both short and we both have shoulder\u2011length brown hair), but we\u2019re opposites in many ways. Mary Anne hates anything athletic. Also she\u2019s the shyest, most sensitive person I ever met. She cries all the time. At movies, some people cry at the sad parts. Mary Anne can tell when the sad parts are coming, and starts crying in advance.\n\nTo tell you the truth, I\u2019d probably be sensitive, too, if my mom had died when I was a baby. Mary Anne was sent away to live with her grandparents until her dad recovered from the loss. Eventually Mr. Spier took her back and raised her by himself. He was extremely strict. Mary Anne had to dress in little\u2011girl clothes and wear her hair in pigtails until seventh grade. But that\u2019s all in the past now. Mr. Spier has loosened up a lot (I\u2019ll tell you why later). Now Mary Anne definitely looks her age. And she happens to be the only member of the BSC who has a steady boyfriend! He\u2019s Logan\u202fBruno, an associate of the club, and he\u2019s cute and athletic and funny and all those good things. He also has this cool Southern accent.\n\nMary Anne is the BSC secretary",

          "text": "n Nitty Gritty Meatballs that had made me laugh the hardest.) Then I wrote a third paragraph telling Ms. Moody about the parts in The Lost Grandmother that made me cry the hardest. Finally I thanked Ms. Moody for deciding to become an author. Then I ended my letter like this:\n\n\n\nOn Monday I mailed the letter. I hardly dared to hope for a reply. And when two weeks went by without one, I stopped hoping. After three weeks, I tried to forget. After four weeks, I really had forgotten. And the very next day a letter with my name on it arrived in the mail. No return address was on it. I opened it curiously.\n\nThe letter was from Amelia Moody. She thanked me for my letter. I could tell hers was just a form letter, printed out on a computer. But I did not care, because after her signature she had added a P.S. in her own handwriting. It said:\n\n\n\nPerhaps? I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\n\n\n\nHow I survived from the day I received Amelia Moody\u2019s letter until the day of the signing is beyond me. The first weeks dragged along like the weeks before my birthday or the weeks before the last day of school. Then when \u2014 finally \u2014 only one more week was left, I suddenly thought of a thousand things. What should I wear to a book signing? (I did not know anyone who had been to one.) What should I say to Ms. Moody? Should I introduce myself? Should I say, \u201cRemember me? I\u2019m your number one fan, the one who wrote you the letter\u201d? Should I bring her a present? If so, what?\n\nOn Monday night, five days before the signing, I sat on my bed in the room I share with Vanessa. I had the room to myself. This was because I had kicked Vanessa out. \u201cPlease, please do your homework in the dining room,\u201d I had said to her. \u201cI really need  privacy.\u201d\n\nSo Vanessa had gone. She was in a daze anyway, working on a new poem. And now I was sitting and thinking. I mulled over my three questions: What should I wear? What should I say? Should I bring a present? I decided that, by far, the clothing question was the least interesting (although I did want to look nice). I tackled it first, in order to get it out of the way.\n\nI opened our closet. I looked inside. I shoved Vanessa\u2019s clothes over to the left and spread mine out a little. I should probably wear a dress, I thought. Ms. Moody had included her birthdate in her letter and I had figured out that she was sixty-four years old. In general, older people like dressed\u2011up kids. This decision, however, presented two more problems. 1. If I dressed up, how dressy should I get? Church dressy? School dressy? School\u2011picture\u2011day dressy? I didn\u2019t want to overdo it, but I did want to please Ms. Moody. 2. What if I was the only kid at the signing who knew Ms. Moody\u2019s age? Would I also be the only one there who was dressed up? I solved this dilemma by deciding I\u2019d rather please Ms. Moody. Then I opted for middle\u2011of\u2011the\u2011road dressy, which meant school\u2011picture\u2011day dressy.\n\nAnd then I had a brilliant idea. I had enclosed my school picture in the letter I had sent Ms. Moody. So I decided to wear the outfit my picture had been taken in. Maybe that would jog Ms. Moody\u2019s memory when she met me. Maybe she would think, Ah, you must be Mallory Pike, the number one fan who wrote me the letter.\n\nBy the time the outfit question was settled, I was exhausted. I decided to hold off on the next two questions until later in the week.",

And not just any author. I am going to meet the author of my favorite books in the world. I am going to meet Amelia Moody, the person who thought up Mandy Madango and The Lost Grandmother and all the other stories, and who told them in a way that made me want to keep reading on and on and on, even after the book had ended.\n\nI shivered. Then I drew in a deep breath. I had to make those butterflies go away. I did not want to be nervous while I was talking to Ms. Moody. I did not want to say something dumb.\n\nAt breakfast that morning, Mom said to me, \u201cToday\u2019s your big day, honey. Are you ready for it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope so. What time are we leaving?\u201d I still needed to get dressed and to pick Ms. Moody\u2019s bouquet.\n\n\u201cAbout eleven\u2011thirty,\u201d replied Mom. \u201cAnd today is going to be a mother\u2011daughter day. Just you and me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only ones going?\u201d I cried. This was too good to be true. Usually my family travels in a pack, like wolves.\n\n\u201cJust us,\u201d said Mom.\n\n\u201cCool.\u201d\n\nWhen breakfast was over I dressed in my school picture outfit. In case you\u2019re wondering, this was a flowered vest over a pink turtleneck with a navy skirt, navy tights, and slip\u2011on shoes. It was not a springy outfit.

          "text": "When Mom and Jeff and I stepped off the plane, Granny and Pop-Pop were waiting for us. Usually when we see each other after a long separation, my grandparents start exclaiming things like, \u201cLook at you! I\u2019m so glad to see you! Oh, you\u2019ve gotten so big! Dawn, you\u2019re so grown-up!\u201d\n\nThis time they just held out their arms and hugged us wordlessly. Then we walked outside to their car. Granny began talking on the drive to Stoneybrook, though. \u201cWait till you see the house we found for you,\u201d she said to Jeff and me. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom showed us pictures,\u201d replied Jeff.\n\n\u201cOh, pictures don\u2019t do it justice. You need to see it for yourself. It\u2019s old \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably falling apart,\u201d said Jeff under his breath.\n\n\u201c\u2014 with a lot of history. I believe it used to be part of the Underground Railroad.\u201d (Jeff didn\u2019t know what that meant, and he didn\u2019t bother to ask.) \u201cIt was built in seventeen ninety-five,\u201d Granny added.\n\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll drive by it this afternoon so you can take a look at it,\u201d said Pop-Pop.\n\nWe did do that. To my surprise, I liked the house. It was very different from our house in California, but that was okay. I thought it had charm. And I liked the fact that it had history. If it was as old as Granny had said, maybe it even had a ghost.\n\nThat night, the time change set in. Jeff and I did not feel tired. Our biological clocks were telling us it was three hours earlier. We were practically bouncing around our grandparents\u2019 house. And all I wanted to do was call Sunny and talk to her for about five hours.\n\n\u201cPlease can I call Sunny?\u201d I begged Mom. \u201cPlease?\u201d\n\n\u201cHoney, no. Not from here. I don\u2019t want Granny and Pop-Pop to have to pay for a long-distance call.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let\u2019s reverse the charges.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want the Winslows to have to pay either.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t Sunny and I ever going to be allowed to talk?\u201d I whined. (I knew I was being a pest.) \u201cYou already took my father away from me. Are you going to take Sunny away, too?\u201d\n\nI honestly thought my mother was going to slap me then. She certainly looked as if she wanted to. And I was certainly being rude enough. Instead, she spun around and left the room. She didn\u2019t talk to me until the next day, and I can\u2019t say I blame her.\n\nI was left in the living room with Granny. (Pop-Pop and Jeff were watching TV in another room.) I could feel her looking at me. I thought, actually, that she might be glaring at me, but when I finally dared to glance at her, I saw that her eyes had filled with tears.\n\nShe held out her arms to me. \u201cCome here, sweetheart,\u201d she said.\n\nI crawled into Granny\u2019s lap as if I were a little girl again. I started to sob. I think that\u2019s why I had wanted to call Sunny. I needed to cry with someone. Granny held me tight. She did not mention what I had said to Mom. But later, I heard her knock on Mom\u2019s door, and then they had a long talk, and Mom cried, too.",

Our clients (Stoneybrook parents) call during meeting times when they need baby\u2011sitters. Everyone in the club has to arrive on time (or face the Wrath of Kristy), and everyone has a title. My stepsister, Mary Anne, is the club\u2019s secretary. She keeps the records and sets up all our sitting appointments. She and Kristy are best friends and sort of look\u2011alikes. Both are short and have dark brown hair and eyes. But Mary Anne is quiet and sensitive, and that makes her \u2026 well, Kristy\u2019s opposite.",

          "text": "I\u2019m dancing. I\u2019m writing one sentence, then dancing around the room. Tour jet\u00e9s. Good ones, better than I\u2019ve ever done in ballet class.\n\nI guess total ecstasy is good for coordination.\n\nMy aunt Cecelia is looking at me as if I\u2019ve lost my mind. Well, maybe I have. This will be the farthest away from home I\u2019ve ever traveled. And I\u2019m going with all my best friends.\n\nWell, almost all.\n\nMallory Pike can\u2019t go. When I think of that, I stop dancing.\n\nMal is my absolute number-one friend in the world. We\u2019re so alike, we can almost read each other\u2019s minds. We\u2019re both horse fanatics. We both love to read. We\u2019re both the oldest kids in our families. Our parents treat us alike, too \u2014 like babies \u2014 even though we\u2019re both eleven. Okay, we have differences. I love to dance, Mal loves to write and illustrate stories. She\u2019s Caucasian and I\u2019m African-American. Still, we\u2019re like sisters.\n\nWhy can\u2019t Mal go to Hawaii? Timing, mostly. And money. You see, the trip was offered to us by our school, Stoneybrook Middle School, last month. We leave in three days, on the next-to-last Monday in July. Nothing like advance warning, huh? Luckily, I had no other plans for the month. But Mal does. She\u2019s helping her neighbor, Mrs. Stone, run a day camp on her farm.\n\nMal thought about finding someone to take her place. Mrs. Stone even said it would be okay. But when Mal mentioned the Hawaii trip to her parents, they said aloha. No way. Too expensive.\n\nThe Pikes just can\u2019t afford the trip. It takes a lot of money to support a family nearly the size of a baseball team. (Mallory has seven younger brothers and sisters.)\n\nAt first my parents didn\u2019t want me to go. But I told them it would be safe (fifty kids and six teacher chaperones are going). They finally agreed to pay for half the trip. I had to earn the other half. My best friends had the same half-and-half deal (yes, our parents did discuss this over the phone).\n\nHow did my friends and I raise the rest of the money? Well, we washed cars, mowed lawns, and held a special Fourth of July festival for kids. And we baby-sat like crazy, of course. We do a lot of that. We all belong to a group called the Baby-sitters Club, or BSC.\n\nBy the way, two other BSC members aren\u2019t going, either. Kristy Thomas is helping with Mrs. Stone\u2019s day camp, too (but her family is going to Hawaii in August, anyway). And Shannon Kilbourne is at summer camp.\n\nToday I decided I would prepare a special gift for Mallory. First I bought a beautiful scrapbook. Next I called all my BSC friends who are going on the trip and asked them to arrive at our regular club meeting twenty minutes early. Then, before Mallory showed up, I began writing in it.\n\nBy the time the meeting started, this is what the first page looked like:\n\nWell, not exactly the neatest start.\n\nThat was okay. It would make Mallory laugh.",

If you were a bug on Claudia\u2019s wall, you\u2019d know exactly which girl was me \u2014 the short, loud one wearing old, casual clothes and a visor. My friends say I \u201cdress down\u201d (or worse), but I think that\u2019s ridiculous. I dress for comfort. And even though I\u2019m just barely five feet tall, what I lack in height, I make up in energy and ingenuity.\n\nActually, I\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t a bug on the wall. I would have swatted you by now.\n\nJust kidding.\n\nAnyway, it was 5:27 on Friday. In three minutes, we would begin our last full meeting of the month. And in three days, on Monday, Mary Anne Spier, Abby Stevenson, Claudia Kishi, Jessi Ramsey, Stacey McGill, Dawn Schafer, and Logan Bruno were going to board a plane to Hawaii.\n\nWhy did I have Hawaii fever? Well, I was going to Hawaii, too, but not until August. It would have been nice to go with my best friends, but I\u2019ll settle for my family. They\u2019re cool.\n\nThey\u2019re large, too. Not large as in fat, but large as in numerous. That\u2019s because we\u2019re two families combined.\n\nFamily number one is the Thomases \u2014 my mom, my three brothers, and me. (Charlie is seventeen, Sam is fifteen, and David Michael is seven.) I suppose I should count my dad. I don\u2019t, usually. He left us soon after David Michael was born and hardly ever keeps in touch. (Frankly, I try not to think about him too much.)\n\nFamily number two is the Brewers. Watson Brewer, my stepdad, is a millionaire. When he fell in love with my mom, she was a single mother raising four kids. We lived in a small house across the street from Claudia and next door to Mary Anne. After Mom and Watson were married, we moved into Watson\u2019s mansion on the other side of town. I had never seen so many rooms in a house before. Plenty for everyone, including Watson\u2019s seven\u2011year\u2011old daughter and four\u2011year\u2011old son (Karen and Andrew) from a previous marriage. They live with us every other month, and with their mom in between.\n\nEmily Michelle is the newest addition to our family. She\u2019s my two\u2011year\u2011old\u2026",

          "text": "Before that day, Richard and Dad had never met. Also, Mom and Dad have stayed on opposite ends of the country since their divorce. They have not even been in the same state together, let alone the same room. I can\u2019t tell you how many hours I\u2019ve spent in an airplane shuttling between the two of them.\n\nWhere do I live? Palo City, California, with Dad. I used to live here, in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. This summer, I was just visiting.\n\nConfusing? It\u2019s not. Just the simple story of Bicoastal Dawn.\n\nYou see, I was born and raised in Palo City. But after my parents split up, Mom decided to move with Jeff and me back to her hometown, which happens to be Stoneybrook. She wanted to be near her fond memories \u2014 and her parents, who still live here.\n\nFrom the very start, Jeff couldn\u2019t make the adjustment. He was miserable. Eventually Mom let him move back with Dad. We were sad to see him go, but we knew he\u2019d be happier. I was pretty homesick for California, too, but I had something Jeff didn\u2019t have. The Baby\u2011sitters Club.\n\nThe BSC members are my absolute best East Coast friends. The club meets three times a week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, from five\u2011thirty until six) in Claudia Kishi\u2019s bedroom, to answer calls from local parents who need sitters. When I lived in Stoneybrook, I was the BSC\u2019s alternate officer. I took over the duties of the president, vice\u2011president, secretary, or treasurer whenever any of them was absent.\n\nIf I hadn\u2019t joined the BSC, I might not have gained my stepfamily.\n\nSoon after I arrived here, I became close to Mary Anne. She introduced me to the BSC. Meantime, we both discovered a deep, dark secret our parents shared. They had been in serious LUV in high school! But my grandparents had dashed their romance. They thought Richard wasn\u2019t good enough for their daughter, so they pressured Mom to break up with him and go away to college. It was bye\u2011bye, Stoneybrook, and hello, heartbreak. (Sob, sob.)\n\nWell, both of them recovered. Mom married Dad, of course, and had Jeff and me. Richard married, too, but Mrs. Spier died when Mary Anne was a baby. Richard was devastated. He became super\u2011protective of Mary Anne and raised her very strictly, insisting she follow lots of rules. She had to wear little\u2011girl clothes and pigtails right up until seventh grade.\n\nBy the time I met Mary Anne, Richard had loosened up a bit. (At least Mary Anne said so. He still seemed stuffy to me.) When we found out their secret, zoom \u2014 Dawn and Mary Anne, Matchmakers Inc., sprang into action! And boy, did those old sparks fly. (Personally, I wouldn\u2019t have predicted it. Richard\u2019s a nice guy but super\u2011organized and conservative; Mom is funny, absentminded, and full of life. Oh, well, I guess opposites attract.)\n\nAnyway, Mary Anne and Richard moved into our house, this incredibly cool two\u2011hundred\u2011year\u2011old farmhouse with a hidden passageway. Life was perfect.\n\nSort of.\n\nUnfortunately, my homesickness really started kicking in. The more I visited Dad and Jeff, the more I knew I had to move back to California. Believe me, leaving Mary Anne and Mom was not easy, but we\u2019ve dealt well with the separation.\n\nTwo lives, two coasts. Both fabulous. I always feel a little split, but I consider myself very lucky.\n\nIn Life One (Palo City), I have a new stepmom. Her name\u2019s Carol, and she\u2019s kind of a blabbermouth, but we get along okay. (She couldn\u2019t take our trip because of her job.) I also have a circle of fantastic friends. My absolute closest one is Sunny Winslow. We grew up together. She and I and two other girls (Jill Henderson and Maggie Blume) started our own baby\u2011sitting organization, the We Kids Club. It\u2019s much more casual than the BSC \u2014 picture poolside meetings with a cell phone and a big spread of natural snacks. Yes, natural. We\u2019re all super\u2011conscious about healthy eating and the environment.\n\nAs you can imagine, being bicoastal means my life is full of tearful farewells and reunions. But none had been quite as tense as this one.",

I mean, I hadn\u2019t spoken to her in weeks, and suddenly, the day before my flight, I was calling to say I was off to Europe.\n\nMaritza lives in Brooklyn, New York. She and I were in a month-long program for promising dancers in NYC, working with the ballet company Dance New\u202fYork. We grew so\u2011o\u2011o\u2011o close during that month. Almost like sisters.\n\nSome sister I was. Long\u2011lost.\n\n\"I know. I\u2019m sorry,\" I replied. \"My school offered this trip really late, and you had to sign up, but the spaces were limited, so I wasn\u2019t exactly sure I\u2019d be going. And we had to have all these meetings, and this Canadian school is taking the trip with us, so we had to learn about \u2014\"\n\n\"Where in Europe?\" Maritza interrupted.\n\n\"England, France \u2026\"\n\n\"London?\"\n\n\"Yeah. And Paris \u2014\"\n\n\"AAAAAAAAUUUUGGHHHHH!\"\n\nI had to take the receiver from my ear. \"I promise I\u2019ll write \u2014\"\n\n\"No. That\u2019s not it. Tanisha\u2019s going to be there! The whole Dance New\u202fYork company is performing there!\"\n\n\"AAAAAAAAUUUUGGHHHHH!\" Now it was my turn to shriek. I could not believe it. My dance company \u2014 the group I trained with, the group I was invited to join \u2014 was going to be with me on my vacation!\n\nOkay, let me explain. First of all, Tanisha is Maritza\u2019s older sister. Tanisha is a member of the \u201cpermanent company,\u201d personally selected by the head of Dance\u202fNY, David\u202fBrailsford. (Yes, the David\u202fBrailsford, ballet legend, and yes, he did ask me to join. And I still may someday. I\u2019m only eleven, so I have time.) Anyway, if you\u2019re in the company, Dance\u202fNY is your school. You take intensive dance classes in the company\u2019s studios in Manhattan, you study your academic subjects with tutors, and you travel all over the world.\n\n\"You have to go see them, Jessi!\" Maritza said. \"They\u2019re playing at a place called the Barbican. And guess what they\u2019re performing? Gotham Rhythm.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nPsssshhhh went my excitement. Like air out of a bicycle tire.\n\nI knew Gotham Rhythm. Maritza and I had learned it during our training. We had performed it at a recital.\n\nWhich means that if I had joined the permanent company, I would have been going to Europe with them. I would have been performing instead of watching.\n\nI did not want to think about that. I was in too good a mood.\n\nBut boy, it was hard to sound cheerful.\n\nI gave Maritza the name of the hotel I\u2019d be staying in. She promised she\u2019d talk to Tanisha.\n\nAfter I hung up, my brain was going a mile a minute.",

Frankly, I couldn\u2019t stand the idea of leaving all my Stoneybrook friends anyway.\n\nI mean, I do love Maritza and my other Dance\u202fNY friends. But Stoneybrook is my home. I belong here.\n\nI haven\u2019t always felt that way. I hated Stoneybrook when I first moved here. Some of our neighbors were awful to my family. They obviously didn\u2019t want African\u2011Americans in their neighborhood. I was dying to move back to my hometown, Oakley, New\u202fJersey, which was much more racially mixed.\n\nThings are better now. People grow up, I guess. Attitudes change. And I don\u2019t miss Oakley as much anymore.\n\nWhat really glues me to Stoneybrook is the Baby\u2011sitters Club.",

Which is pretty funny, considering how different we seem on the surface. For one thing, Mal has pale, freckly skin and reddish\u2011brown hair. She doesn\u2019t dance at all, and she\u2019s obsessed with creative writing and illustrating. Plus she has a huge, unruly family that includes eight kids \u2014 and cousins all over the globe. (Well, at least in England. She was planning to visit them during our trip.) The very ruly Ramseys, on the other hand, all live in the States, as far as I know, and our branch has only three kids (me, Becca, and my baby brother, Squirt).\n\nWhat do Mal and I have in common? Well, each of us is the oldest child in the family. That means our parents expect us to be perfect but treat us like babies. (If you\u2019re an eldest sib, you know what I mean. The younger ones have it so much easier.) But the main thing we share is passion. We do things in a big way. Mal is as dedicated to writing as I am to dancing. Also, we both love horses and horse books, and we have read just about every one ever written.\n\nBut most of all, we are passionate about baby\u2011sitting. You have to feel that way to be part of the Baby\u2011Sitters Club.\n\nMal and I are junior officers. We\u2019re the only sixth\u2011graders among thirteen\u2011year\u2011old eighth\u2011graders, so it\u2019s kind of an honor to be included. Not that anyone ever says that. We treat each other as equals. Mal and I do everything the other members do \u2014 well, except baby\u2011sit away from home at night. But that\u2019s only because our parents won\u2019t allow us to. (I told you they treat us like babies.)\n\nThe basic idea of the BSC?\n\nA. Gather a group of reliable sitters at one phone number.\n\nB. Make yourselves available during convenient hours for booking jobs (in our case, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from five\u2011thirty until six).\n\nC. Let local parents know about the group.\n\nD. Wait for the job offers to pour in.\n\nSimple, huh? Parents have one\u2011stop shopping, sitters have regular work (plus an excuse for best friends to hang out together three times a week), and everybody\u2019s happy.\n\nWho\u2019s the genius behind this idea? Picture a short, athletic\u2011looking Caucasian seventh\u2011grader who can\u2019t sit still. She has brown eyes and shoulder\u2011length brown hair, and she\u2019s dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt. Ta\u2011da: Kristy Thomas. Now imagine her living in a little house with three brothers (two older and one younger) and a mom who is single because Kristy\u2019s dad skipped out on the family. Now picture Kristy watchin",
