          "text": "The Baby\u2011sitters Club. I\u2019m proud to say it was totally my idea, even though the four of us worked it out together. \u201cUs\u201d is Mary Anne Spier, Claudia Kishi, Stacey McGill, and me \u2014 Kristy Thomas. But that was at the beginning of seventh grade, after the summer in which my friendship with Claudia nearly fell apart, Mary Anne began to find out who she was, Claudia experienced her first love, and an unhappy girl left New York City and moved to our town. It was quite a summer.\n\nWhen Mary Anne and Claudia and Stacey and I talked about it later (when we were older), we discovered that during those long hot months we had all, separately, felt that we didn\u2019t quite belong where we were. Not one of us. Up until that summer we hadn\u2019t paid much attention to such things. But now Mary Anne felt that she was suddenly teetering between childhood and teenagehood, or whatever you call it, and that she didn\u2019t fit into either world. Claudia felt that she was drifting away from Mary Anne and me, drifting toward her own teenagehood alone \u2014 while Mary Anne and I lingered on the shore. Stacey had survived a horrible year and had been shunned by her classmates and friends, and now her parents had decided to move the family here to Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where she knew absolutely no one. And I, Kristin Amanda Thomas, felt like a stranger in my family. I would look around at my mom and my brothers, who were oh\u2011so\u2011happy with Mom\u2019s new boyfriend, Watson, and I\u2019d think, How can they leave Dad behind? Am I the only one who still wants him to be part of the family? And so I decided to give my father a second chance.\n\nThe summer started off like most of the other summers of my life. But by the end of it, everything was different. We were different. And the summer brought the four of us, Claudia, Stacey, Mary Anne, and me, together to form the Baby\u2011sitters Club \u2014 something we would belong to, in one sense or another, for the rest of our lives.",

          "text": "When the bell rang at the end of the last day of sixth grade, I was ready. I had cleaned out my locker early that morning before school began \u2014 and I mean really cleaned it. With a tiny bottle of Fantastik and a bunch of paper towels that I had stuffed into my backpack before I left home. I had removed every last scrap of paper from the locker, every old eraser, every gum wrapper and paper clip and pencil stub, plus one gray sock, and thrown them away (including the sock, which smelled). Then I had scrubbed the locker down with the Fantastik. I wasn\u2019t taking any chances on being called at home in a day or two about the condition of my locker. I did not want to have to set foot in Stoneybrook Middle School again until September, when seventh grade would begin. So when that last bell rang, I ran from my language arts class (calling a hasty and not at all heartfelt good\u2011bye over my shoulder to Mrs. Alpin, whom I loathed) directly to the front door of SMS, where I met Mary Anne, my best friend in the world. Mary Anne had also cleaned her locker thoroughly that morning, and the two of us had not one single school responsibility left.\n\nWe had to wait for Claudia, though. Claud had not thought quite as far ahead as we had, and she still had to deal with her locker and also have a chat with her math teacher, whose class she had not exactly flunked but hadn\u2019t quite passed, either. These were Claud\u2019s words, and while they didn\u2019t make sense to me, I didn\u2019t care. School was out!\n\n\u201cYou know what my grandmother used to shout on the last day of school?\u201d I said to Mary Anne as we waited, lolling against the door frame and watching kids stream past us, calling and hooting.\n\n\u201cNo. What?\u201d I could tell that Mary Anne was impatient for Claudia to show up.\n\n\u201cShe used to shout, \u2018School\u2019s out! School\u2019s out! Teacher wore her bloomers out!\u2019 \u201d\n\nMary Anne stared at me. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she said finally.\n\n\u201cWell, how should I know? It just sounds funny.\u201d\n\nMary Anne twirled the end of one brown braid thoughtfully around her finger. \u201cMaybe \u2014\u201d she started to say.\n\nBut I interrupted her. \u201cThere\u2019s Claudia.\u201d\n\nMary Anne turned around and we saw Claud coming toward us through the crowded corridor at a pace ordinarily reserved for snails and turtles. She was walking arm in arm with Dori Wallingford. Howie Johnson and Pete Black were flanking them.\n\n\u201cDori,\u201d Mary Anne muttered.\n\n\u201cBoys,\u201d I muttered.\n\nClaudia and Mary Anne and I used to sit together at lunch sometimes, but that had changed between our winter break and our spring break. Dori and several other girls who were more interested in clothes than in practically anything else had suddenly become more interesting to Claudia than Mary Anne and me or practically anyone else. Except boys.\n\nClaudia waved cheerfully to her new friends. \u201cSee you!\u201d she called as Dori and Howie and Pete crossed the lawn to the line of waiting school buses. \u201cHi, you guys,\u201d she said to Mary Anne and me, and for an instant I felt like something hanging on the Reduced rack at Bellair\u2019s Department Store.\n\n\u201cHey, Claud,\u201d said Mary Anne as we began our walk to Bradford Court, \u201cwhat do you think \u2018Teacher wore her bloomers out\u2019 means?\u201d",

I\u2019m proud to say it was totally my idea, even though the four of us worked it out together. \u201cUs\u201d is Mary Anne Spier, Claudia Kishi, Stacey McGill, and me\u2014Kristy Thomas.\n\nI got the idea on the first Tuesday afternoon of seventh grade. It was a very hot day. It was so hot that in my un-air-conditioned school, Stoneybrook Middle School, the teachers had opened every single window and door and turned off all the lights. My hair stuck damply to the back of my neck, and I wished I had a rubber band so I could pull it into a long ponytail. Bees flew into the classroom and droned around our heads, and Mr. Redmont, our teacher, let us stop working to make fans out of construction paper. The fans didn\u2019t do much except keep the bees away, but it was nice to take up ten minutes of social studies making them.\n\nAnyway, that stifling afternoon dragged on forever, and when the hands of the clock on the front wall of our classroom finally hit 2:42 and the bell rang, I leaped out of my seat and shouted, \u201cHooray!\u201d I was just so glad that it was time to get out of there. I like school and everything, but sometimes enough is enough.\n\nMr. Redmont looked shocked. He was probably thinking he\u2019d been so nice letting us make fans, and there I was, not appreciating it at all, just glad the day was over.\n\nI felt bad, but I couldn\u2019t help what I\u2019d done. I\u2019m like that. I think of something to say, and I say it. I think of something to do, and I do it. Mom calls it impulsive. Sometimes she calls it trouble. But she doesn\u2019t just mean trouble. She means trouble.\n\nAnd I was in trouble then. I could sense it. I\u2019ve been in enough trouble to know when it\u2019s coming.\n\nMr. Redmont cleared his throat. He was trying to think of a way to punish me without humiliating me in front of the other kids. Things like that are important to him.\n\n\u201cKristy,\u201d Mr. Redmont began, and then he changed his mind and started over. \u201cClass,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have your homework assignments. You may go. Kristy, I\u2019d like to see you for a minute.\u201d\n\nWhile the rest of the kids gathered up their books and papers and left the room, talking and giggling, I made my way up to Mr. Redmont\u2019s desk. Before he could say a word, I began apologizing to him. Sometimes that helps.\n\n\u201cMr. Redmont,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I didn\u2019t mean anything. I mean, I didn\u2019t mean I was glad school was over. I meant I was glad I could go home. Because my house is air-conditioned\u2026.\u201d\n\nMr. Redmont nodded. \u201cBut do you think, Kristy, that it would be possible, in the future, for you to conduct yourself with a bit more decorum?\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure of the exact meaning of decorum, but I had a pretty good idea it meant not spoiling Mr. Redmont\u2019s day by jumping up and shouting hooray when the bell rang.\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I said. Sometimes being polite also helps.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Mr. Redmont. \u201cBut I want you to remember this incident, and the best way for us to remember things is to write them down. So tonight, I would like you to write a one-hundred-word essay on the importance of decorum in the classroom.\u201d\n\nDarn. I\u2019d have to find out what decorum meant after all.\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I said again.\n\nI went back to my desk, gathered up my books very slowly, and then walked very slowly out of the classroom. I hoped Mr. Redmont was noticing the slowness because I was betting it was an important part of decorum.\n\nI found Mary Anne Spier waiting for me outside the door to my classroom. She was leaning against the wall, biting her nails.\n\nMary Anne is my best friend. We live next door to each other. We even look a little alike. We\u2019re both small for our age and we both have brown hair that falls past our shoulders. But that\u2019s where the similarity ends, because I can\u2019t keep my mouth shut, and Mary Anne is very quiet and very shy. Luckily, that\u2019s only on the outside. The people who know her well, like Claudia and Stacey and me, get to see the inside of her, and the Mary Anne who\u2019s hiding in there is a lot of fun.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d I greeted her. I pulled her hand out of her mouth and looked at her nails. \u201cMary Anne! How do you ever expect to be able to wear nail polish if you keep doing that?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cNail polish. I\u2019ll be seventy-five before my father lets me wear it.\u201d\n\nMary Anne\u2019s father is the only family she\u2019s got. Her mother is dead, and she has no brothers or sisters. Unfortunately, her father is pretty strict. My mother says it\u2019s just because Mr. Spier is nervous since Mary Anne is all he\u2019s got. You\u2019d think, though, that he could let her wear her hair down instead of always in braids, or give her permission to ride her bike to the mall with Claudia and me once in a while. But no. At Mr. Spier\u2019s house it\u2019s rules, rules, rules. It\u2019s a miracle that Mary Anne was even allowed to become a member of the Baby-sitters Club.\n\nWe walked out of school, and suddenly I began running. I forgot all about decorum, because I\u2019d just remembered something else. \u201cOh, my gosh!\u201d I cried.\n\nMary Anne raced after me. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she panted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Tuesday,\u201d I called over my shoulder.\n\n\u201cSo? Slow down, Kristy. It\u2019s too hot to run.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t slow down. Tuesday is my afternoon to watch David Michael. I\u2019m supposed to beat him home. Otherwise he gets home first and has to watch himself.\u201d\n\nDavid Michael is my six-year-old brother.\n\nMy big brothers, Charlie and Sam, and I are each responsible for him one afternoon a week until Mom gets home from work. Kathy, this fifteen-year-old girl who lives a few blocks from us, watches him the other two afternoons. Kathy gets paid to watch him. Charlie and Sam and I don\u2019t.\n\nMary Anne and I ran all the way home. We reached my front yard, sweaty and out of breath. And there was David Michael, sitting forlornly on the front steps, his dark curls falling limply across his forehead.\n\nHe burst into tears as soon as he saw us.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked. I sat down beside him and put my arm around his shoulders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m locked out,\u201d he wailed.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to your key?\u201d\n\nDavid",

So Kristy had this idea that the three of us should get together to form a group of baby\u2011sitters, advertise ourselves, and have a little business, which is just what we did. Plus, we asked a new friend of mine, Stacey McGill, to join, which she did. The Baby\u2011sitters Club is working really well. People know about us and call us all the time, and each of us has more jobs now than before the Baby\u2011sitters Club, so it was important that I be allowed to stay in it.

I\u2019m supposed to try to do the work on my own, but one of them sits next to me to keep me from daydreaming, to make sure I do each assignment completely, to see that I follow directions and stuff, and to answer questions if I have them. They\u2019re not supposed to do the homework for me, but sometimes I can get Janine to give me answers. This is because my dumb homework is so boring for her, as she tells me at least twice every time she has to help me, that she\u2019ll do anything to speed it along. Well, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not up to trigonomulus, or whatever it is she does. We can\u2019t all be scholars.\n\nMimi, my grandmother, is the best person to help me. She\u2019s quiet and soft\u2011spoken and endlessly patient. My family is Japanese, and Mimi and my grandfather (who died long before I was born) brought my mother to the United States when Mom was just a little girl. Mom has no accent whatsoever (neither does my father, who also came to the United States as a small child), but Mimi has this pleasant, rolling accent that reminds me of a ship at sea. And she is polite, polite, polite, never speaking a harsh word.\n\nI got out my social studies text.\n\n\u201cWhat do we have between the covers of this book?\u201d asked Mimi, who thinks books are eyes into the hearts and lives of other people (peoples?). She told me so once.\n\n\u201cSocial studies,\u201d I replied. \u201cWe read chapter three in class today. Now we have to answer the discussion questions at the end of the chapter\u2026. Mimi, if they\u2019re discussion questions, why aren\u2019t we discussing them? How come Mr. Miller is making us write them down?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know, my Claudia, but if that is the assignment, then you must complete it as your teacher wishes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Boy, did I know. A few weeks ago, I would have written down one\u2011word answers or skipped the assignment altogether. Now there was no way out.\n\nI began to write. Mimi looked on, every now and then pointing out a misspelled word or suggesting that I check my punctuation. After social studies came math and then English, and at last I was done. I breathed a sigh that was relief mixed with boredom.\n\n\u201cAnd what are you going to do now, my Claudia?\u201d asked Mimi.\n\n\u201cGet back to The Phantom of Pine Hill,\u201d I replied, slapping my English text closed.",

          "text": "\u201cAs president of the Baby-sitters Club,\u201d said Kristy Thomas, \u201cI hereby move that we figure out what to do when Mrs. Newton goes to the hospital to have her baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWell, we ought to be prepared. We\u2019ve been waiting for this baby for months, and the Newtons are practically our best clients. They\u2019ll need someone to take care of Jamie while his parents are at the hospital. Smart baby-sitters would be ready for the occasion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d spoke up Mary Anne Spier. \u201cI second the motion.\u201d Mary Anne usually agrees with Kristy. After all, they\u2019re best friends.\n\nI glanced across the room at Claudia Kishi. Claudia is my best friend, and vice president of our club. She shrugged her shoulders at me.\n\nThere are just the four of us in the Baby-sitters Club: Kristy, Claudia, Mary Anne (she\u2019s the secretary), and me, Stacey McGill. I\u2019m the treasurer. We\u2019ve been in business for about two months. Kristy thought up the club, which was why she got to be president. We meet three times a week from five-thirty to six o\u2019clock in Claudia\u2019s room (Claudia has a private phone), and our clients call then to line us up as sitters. The reason the club works so well is that with four baby-sitters there at the phone, each person who calls is pretty much guaranteed to get a sitter for whatever time he or she needs. Our clients like that. They say that having to make a whole bunch of calls just to line up one sitter is a waste of time. They like us, too. We\u2019re good baby-sitters. And we worked hard to get our business going. We printed up flyers and distributed them in mailboxes, and even put an ad in The Stoneybrook News, the voice of Stoneybrook, Connecticut.\n\nThat\u2019s where I live now, in this teeny-weeny town in Connecticut. Let me tell you, it\u2019s quite a shock after life in New York City. New York is a big place. Stoneybrook is not. There is only one middle school here, and I go to it. We all do. (We\u2019re in seventh grade.) In New York there are about a billion middle schools. In fact, in New York there are about a billion of everything\u2014people, cars,buildings, stores, pigeons, friends, and things to do.\n\nHere there\u2019s, well, there\u2019s \u2026 not much, really. My parents and I moved into our house in August and I didn\u2019t make a single friend until I met Claudia in school in September. Everyone here seems to have known everyone else since they were babies. Claudia, Kristy, and Mary Anne have. And they\u2019ve grown up together, since Kristy and Mary Anne live next door to each other on Bradford Court and Claudia lives across the street from them. (I live two streets away.)\n\nSo, was I ever glad when Claudia told me Kristy wanted to start the club! Friends at last, I thought. And that\u2019s just what I found. Even though I\u2019m better friends with Claudia, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without Kristy and Mary Anne. It\u2019s true that they seem younger than Claudia and me (they don\u2019t care much about clothes or boys yet\u2014although Kristy did just go to her first dance), and Mary Anne is unbelievably shy, and Kristy\u2019s sort of a tomboy. But they\u2019re my friends, and I belong with them. Which is more than I can say about certain traitors I left behind in New York.\n\n\u201cAll right, here\u2019s one plan,\u201d Kristy was saying. \u201cIt\u2019s a school afternoon. Mrs. Newton realizes that it\u2019s time to go to the hospital. She calls Mr. Newton or a cab or whatever, then calls us, and one of us goes to stay with Jamie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if we\u2019re all busy?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Kristy. \u201cMaybe from now on, one of us should be free each afternoon so Mrs. Newton will be guaranteed a baby-sitter. It will be a special service for her, since the Newtons are such good customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat seems like kind of a waste,\u201d spoke up Claudia, which was exactly what I was thinking.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I said. \u201cBabies can be late. Two or three weeks late. We could be giving up an awful lot of perfectly good afternoons for nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said Kristy thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cHow about a nighttime plan?\u201d I suggested. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem that pregnant women always rush off to the hospital in the middle of the night? I was born at two-twenty-two A.M.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was born at four-thirty-six A.M.,\u201d said Claudia.\n\n\u201cI was born at four A.M. on the dot,\u201d said Kristy.\n\nWe looked at Mary Anne. She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know what time I was born.\u201d Mary Anne\u2019s mother died when Mary Anne was little, and Mary Anne is not very close to her strict father. It figures that they\u2019d never talked about the day (or night) she was born.\n\nA knock came on Claudia\u2019s door. Mimi, her grandmother, stuck her head in the room. \u201cHello, girls,\u201d she said politely.\n\n\u201cHi, Mimi,\u201d we answered.\n\n\u201cMay I offer you something to eat?\u201d she asked. Claudia\u2019s family is Japanese, and Mimi, who didn\u2019t come to the United States until she was thirty-two years old, speaks with a gentle, rolling accent. She has lived with Claudia\u2019s family since before Claudia was born.\n\n\u201cNo thanks, Mimi,\u201d replied Claudia, \u201cbut maybe you could help us.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d Mimi opened the door the rest of the way and stood just inside the room.\n\n\u201cDo you know what time Mary Anne was born?\u201d Claudia asked. She figured Mimi would know since Claudia\u2019s parents have been friendly with the Thomases and the Spiers for years, and Mimi had gotten to know the families, too.\n\nMimi looked only slightly taken aback. \u201cLet me think for a moment, my Claudia\u2026. Mary Anne, your mother and father left for the hospital around dinnertime. That I remember clearly. I believe you were born near eleven o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d A grin lit up Mary Anne\u2019s face. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. So I was another nighttime baby. Thank you, Mimi.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d Mimi turned to leave, and almost bumped into Janine, Claudia\u2019s sister, who had come up behind her.\n\n\u201cClaudia! Claudia!\u201d cried Janine.\n\nI looked up in alarm. Janine is this prim, not-much-fun fifteen-year-old who\u2019s a genius. To be honest, she\u2019s boring. Dull as dishwater. I\u2019d never even heard her raise her voice, which was why, the minute I heard her cry \u201cClaudia!",

We\u2019ve grown up together. And since my mother died when I was really little, leaving just Dad and me, Kristy\u2019s been like my sister, and Mrs. Thomas is like my mother. (Kristy\u2019s parents got divorced a few years ago and her dad walked out, but my father has not been like a father to Kristy.

Claudia and Janine were born in the United States. Both of their parents came to America when they were little. Mimi was in her thirties, I think, when she left Japan, so she still speaks with an accent. I like her accent. It\u2019s soft and nice to listen to.\n\n\"Hi, Mimi,\" we replied.\n\n\"How is the scarf coming, Mary Anne?\" she asked. (Mimi taught me how to knit. She\u2019s helping me make a scarf for my father.)\n\n\"It\u2019s fine,\" I said. \"I\u2019m almost done, but I\u2019ll need you to help me with the fringe.\"\n\n\"Of course.

She\u2019s only fifteen and already she\u2019s taking classes at Stoneybrook University. She corrects absolutely everything you say to her. Kristy and I avoid her as much as possible.\n\nThat day, we were lucky. Janine wasn\u2019t even home. When we ran by her room, it was dark.\n\n\"Hi!\" we greeted Claudia.\n\n\"Hi,\" she replied, her voice muffled. Claudia had her head in her pajama bag as she rummaged around at the bottom of it. In a moment she straightened up, proudly holding out three Ring Dings.\n\nClaudia is a junk-food addict. She buys candy and Twinkies and Yodels and other things and hides the stuff all over her room. She eats it at any time (and eats her meals, too) and never seems to gain an ounce, or to get so much as the hint of a pimple.\n\nShe handed us each a Ring Ding, but I turned mine down. Dad gets upset if I don\u2019t eat a proper dinner (or breakfast or lunch), and I don\u2019t have a very big appetite. Claudia tossed the Ring Ding back in her pajama bag. She wasn\u2019t going to offer it to Stacey when she arrived, since Stacey has diabetes and can\u2019t eat most sweets.\n\n\"Any calls yet?\" I asked. It was just barely 5:30, but sometimes our clients called early.\n\n\"One,\" replied Claudia. \"Kristy\u2019s mom. She needs someone for David Michael on Thursday.\"\n\nKristy nodded. \"Our regular two-day-a-week sitter finally quit. Mom\u2019ll be calling more often for a while.\"\n\nKristy has two brothers in high school, Sam and Charlie, and a little brother, David Michael, who\u2019s six. Sam, Charlie, and Kristy are each responsible for David Michael one afternoon a week. Mrs. Thomas had had a baby-sitter lined up for him for the other two days, but I knew the sitter had been canceling a lot.\n\n\"Hey, everybody!\" called a voice. Stacey entered Claudia\u2019s room, looking gorgeous, as usual.\n\nIf you ask Stacey, she\u2019ll tell you she\u2019s plain, but that\u2019s crazy. Stacey is glamorous. She moved to Stoneybrook, Connecticut, from New York City last summer. She\u2019s very sophisticated, and is even allowed to have her hair professionally styled, so that she has this fabulous-looking shaggy blonde mane, and she wears the neatest clothes \u2014 big, baggy shirts and tight-fitting pants \u2014 and amazing jewelry, like parrots and palm trees. She even has a pair of earrings that consist of a dog for one ear and a bone for the other ear.\n\nI\u2019d give anything to be Stacey. Not to have diabetes, of course, but to have lived in New York City and to be able to dress up like a model every day. My father lets me dress like a model, too \u2014 a model of a six-year-old. I have to wear my hair in braids (that\u2019s a rule), and he has to approve my outfit every day, which is sort of silly since he buys all m",

The other girls in the club have titles, like Mary Anne Spier, secretary, or Claudia Kishi, vice president. But I'm just me.\n\nThe club is the most important thing in my life. If it weren't for the club, I wouldn't be riding my bicycle off to another baby-sitting job at this very moment. And if it weren't for all the babysitting jobs I've gotten, I wouldn't know so many people here in Stoneybrook.\n\nSee, I've only lived in Connecticut a few months. Until this past January, I lived in California with my parents and my younger brother, Jeff. But last fall Mom and Dad split up, and Mom decided to move back to the place where she grew up. Her parents still live here. So right after Christmas, Jeff and I were uprooted from hot, sunny California and transplanted to cold, sloppy Connecticut, where (so far) it's never been warm enough for me.\n\nI hate cold weather. On the days when the temperature slips back a few degrees, I yell at the weatherman. On the days when it creeps up, I congratulate him and apologize for yelling. I'm still not sure what the big deal about New England winters is all about. Back in California, we had one season: summer. I thought it was wonderful. I loved the beach, I loved sunshine, I loved eighty-degree Christmases. Why, I wondered, would anyone want to interrupt all that warmth with three other seasons?",

          "text": "The family I was baby-sitting for that afternoon was the Pikes. There are eight Pike children \u2014 and three of them are triplets! However, I wasn't going to sit for all of them. The triplets, who are nine-year-old boys, would be at ice hockey practice (my brother Jeff was there, too), and eight-year-old Vanessa would be at her violin lesson. That left Nicky, who's seven; Margo (six); Claire (four); and Mallory, who's ten and usually a big help.\n\nWhen I reached the Pikes', I parked my bicycle at the side of the driveway and rang the doorbell.\n\n\"I'll get it! I'll get it!\" cried a voice from inside.\n\nThe door was flung open by Claire, the youngest Pike. She loves answering the door and the phone.\n\n\"Hi, Claire!\" I said brightly.\n\nClaire suddenly turned shy. She put her finger in her mouth and looked at the floor. \"Hi,\" she replied.\n\n\"I'm Dawn. Remember me?\"\n\nClaire nodded.\n\n\"Can I come in?\"\n\nShe nodded again.\n\nAs I was opening the door, Mrs. Pike ran down the stairs. \"Oh, it's you, Dawn. Terrific! You're right on time. How are you?\"\n\n\"Fine, thanks,\" I answered.\n\nI really like Mrs. Pike. She has lots of energy and she loves kids. (She'd have to, I guess.) She's patient and funny and hardly ever yells. She and Mr. Pike have been really nice to our family ever since we moved here.\n\n\"I'm just going to be at a meeting of the trustees of the public library. The library number is on the bulletin board by the phone. If you need to call me, ask for the Prescott Room and say that I'm in the board meeting, okay?\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n(Mrs. Pike is always so organized. She's a baby-sitter's dream.)\n\n\"The emergency numbers are in their usual spot, and the kids can have a snack \u2014 a small one \u2014 if they're hungry. I'll be home a little after five. Is that all right?\"\n\n\"Perfect. We have a Baby-sitters Club meeting at five-thirty.\"",

She's the one who had the idea for the club.\n\nThe vice president is Claudia Kishi, who's really neat and sophisticated. She lives across the street from Kristy. We hold our meetings in Claudia's room because she has a phone. Claudia is Japanese and beautiful. She hates school, but loves art and mystery stories. She's a little bit hard to get to know.\n\nThe club treasurer is Stacey McGill. Stacey moved to Stoneybrook just a few months before I did, so we have something in common. She came from New York City, and I know she had trouble getting adjusted to small-town life. Sometimes we talk about that.\n\nThen there's Mary Anne Spier. She's the one who introduced me to Kristy, Claudia, and Stacey. She's the secretary of the club and responsible for the Baby-sitters Club Record Book, which is where she records our job appointments, as well as the phone numbers and addresses of our clients and stuff like that. (Also in that book is a record of the money we earn. Stacey's in charge of that section.)\n\nWe keep a Baby-sitters Club Notebook, too, which is like a diary. Kristy insists that we write up each job we take and that we all read the book every few days. That's so we know what's going on in the families the club sits for.\n\nThe most important thing about Mary Anne (to me, anyway) is that she's my new best friend. (My old best friend was Sunny Winslow in California.) Mary Anne lives next door to Kristy Thomas, and for the longest time Kristy was her only best friend. Now I'm Mary Anne's other best friend.",

Not only that, they dated \u2014 for a long time. They were really serious about each other. Mary Anne and I found all this romantic stuff they'd written to each other in their senior yearbooks.\n\nEven more amazing is that they've started dating each other again! (Mary Anne's mother died when Mary Anne was really little.) Mary Anne and I can hardly believe that our parents are out. It's so exciting! Mr. Spier is this stern, lonely guy who needs some fun in his life (and something to think about besides Mary Anne, who's his only kid). And my mom has been so sad since the divorce.

When he died, his ghost stayed behind. I'm telling you, he haunts our attic.\"\n\nKaren Brewer looked at me with wide eyes. \"Honest, Kristy. He haunts our attic,\" she repeated. Karen loves to talk about witches and ghosts. She thinks her next-door neighbor, old Mrs. Porter, is a witch named Morbidda Destiny.\n\nKaren's four-year-old brother, Andrew, turned to me with eyes as round as an owl's. He didn't say a word.\n\n\"I think you're scaring your brother,\" I told Karen.\n\n\"No, she's not,\" whispered Andrew. I leaned over to him. \"Are you sure?\" I whispered back.\n\n\"No.\" I could barely hear him.\n\n\"I think that's enough talk about ghosts,\" I said.\n\n\"Okay,\" replied Karen. Her tone of voice implied that it was foolish of me not to arm myself with information about old Ben. \"But when you move into our house, you'll wish you knew more about my great-great-grandfather. Especially if you get a bedroom on the third floor.\" Karen made \"the third floor\" sound like Frankenstein's castle.\n\nI couldn't help giving a little shiver.

          "text": "Karen and Andrew are the children of Watson Brewer, who is engaged to my mother, the divorced Elizabeth Thomas. This means that when they get married, Karen and Andrew will become my little stepsister and stepbrother. It also means that my brothers and I will be moving out of our house on Bradford Court, where we grew up, and into Watson's house.\n\nThere are pros and cons to this situation. The pros are that Watson is rich. In fact, he's a millionaire. And his house isn't just a house, it's a mansion. Charlie and Sam, my older brothers, who have shared a room for years, will each have his own bedroom at Watson's. They could probably each have a suite of rooms if they asked nicely. And David Michael, my little brother (he just turned seven), will finally have a room bigger than a closet.\n\nI don't benefit at all where bedrooms are concerned since I already have my own and I think the size is fine. The main drawback to moving to Watson's is that he lives across town. I have never lived anywhere but right here on Bradford Court. All my friends are here. Mary Anne Spier lives next door, Claudia Kishi lives across the street, and Stacey McGill and Dawn Schafer live nearby. The five of us make up the Baby-sitters Club (I'm the president), and it won't be nearly as easy to run the club when I live clear on the other side of Stoneybrook, Connecticut.\n\nThe other \"con\" is that Watson is mostly okay, but sometimes he can be a jerk.\n\n\"Kristy? Karen? Andrew?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mom?\" It was a Saturday evening, and my mother had invited Watson and his kids over for dinner.",

And I know them well since I've been sitting for them off and on for about nine months, since the time the Baby-sitters Club began. Watson and their mother are divorced, and while they live with their mother, they do spend every other weekend and certain vacations with Watson, and some in-between time, too, if they want. The arrangement is pretty loose.\n\n\"Dinner's ready!\" called Mom.\n\n\"Come on, you guys,\" I said. \"You know what we're having?\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Andrew cautiously. He's a very picky eater.\n\n\"We're having spaghetti.\"\n\n\"Oh, yum!\" cried Karen.\n\n\"Pasketti?\" Andrew repeated. \"Jody Jones said pasketti is dead worms.\"\n\n\"Ew, ew, ew!\" exclaimed Karen.\n\n\"Well, Jody Jones is wrong,\" I told them. \"Spaghetti is ... noodles. That's all.\"\n\nWe entered through the back door of our house and went into the dining room. The table was set for eight. Candles were burning and the lights were dimmed. A bottle of red wine stood next to Watson's place. The dining room had been transformed into an Italian restaurant.\n\n\"This looks great, Mom,\" I said, \"but it's June. We should be eating outside. We're wasting the nice weather.\"\n\n\"Oh, honey,\" my mother replied. \"Eat spaghetti on our laps? That sounds like the start of a Tide commercial. We'll be much better off in here.\"\n\nI laughed. Ever since Mom got engaged to Watson, she's been in a great mood.\n\nMy brothers crowded around the table. (They're never too far off when food is about to be served.)\n\nKaren and Andrew approached them shyly. (Yes, even Karen gets shy sometimes.) I think she's shy around Charlie, Sam, and David Michael because she knows they're going to become her stepbrothers and she wants to make a good impression on them. She knows me a lot better than she knows them because of all the babysitting I've done for her and for Andrew.\n\n\"Hi, Charlie. Hi, Sam. Hi, David Michael,\" Karen addressed each one solemnly.\n\n\"Hi, kid,\" replied Charlie. (Charlie is my seventeen-year-old brother. He just got his driver's license.)\n\nSam, who's fifteen, couldn't answer Karen because he was busy scarfing up olives from a little dish my mother had set on the table next to the pepper grinder.\n\n\"Hey, Mom!\" I called into the kitchen. \"We need an olive refill.\"\n\nSam gave me a dirty look.\n\nWhile we kids stood around waiting for Mom and Watson, who were doing last-minute spaghetti things in the kitchen, Karen and David Michael eyed each other. Mom is afraid there's going to be some trouble between the two of them after the wedding. David Michael is used to being the baby of the family. He's not just the youngest, he's the much-youngest. There's a ten-year difference between Charlie and him. There's even a five-and-a-half-year difference between him and me. (I'll be thirteen in August.) But suddenly he's going to acquire a part-time six-year-old sister and four-year-old brother.\n\nMeanwhile, Karen is used to being the oldest. And she's going to acquire three part-time older brothers, plus me.\n\nFurthermore, Karen and David Michael are so close in age that Mom i",

This is because I don't like school.\n\nIn the summer, no one has to prod me. I like vacation and I love art classes. I love drawing and painting and crafts.\n\nI am thirteen years old, which means I am now officially a teenager. Mom says that doesn't mean much, because I've always been a teenager. By that, I think she means that I can be difficult to live with. I'm smart, but I don't like school or homework. My family is conservative, but I'm wild. I like loud clothes. I like to dance. I can be a real pain sometimes.\n\nOn the other hand, Janine, who is sixteen, has never been a teenager, according to my mother. Janine is smart and likes school. Actually, that's not quite right. She's super\u2011smart (a genius), and she doesn't just go to school. She goes, as I mentioned, to college. Well, she takes college courses, but she's still a high school student. She'll be a junior at Stoneybrook High this fall. Anyway, she never gives anybody a lick of trouble. She studies, studies, studies. My parents think she's wonderful. They brag to our relatives about how she's only sixteen and can handle college work. They expect her to become something really important, like a physicist.\n\nJanine wears clothes that are blah, blah, blah. When she outgrows them and passes them along to me, I pass them right along to Kristy Thomas or Mary Anne Spier, who live across the street. They don't care too much about clothes, but I wouldn't be caught dead in Janine's things. I'd rather have to pay for all new clothes with the money I earn baby\u2011sitting than wear Janine's free but yucky button\u2011down shirts, gray kilts, and crew\u2011neck sweaters.",

I was the second one into the kitchen.\n\nMimi greeted me in her gentle way. \"Good morning, my Claudia,\" she said softly. I hardly notice Mimi's accent anymore, but she does have one. Our family is Japanese, and Mimi, who is Mom's mother, didn't come to the United States until she was in her thirties. I'm surprised she speaks English as well as she does, I mean, considering that for half her life she spoke only Japanese.\n\n\"Morning, Mimi!\" I replied.\n\nMimi was fixing breakfast. (She was not, however, the person who'd been yelling about the coffee earlier. That was my father. Every morning, he comes downstairs as soon as he stumbles out of bed, and gets the coffee going pronto for himself and Mom. They practically can't see without a little caffeine in their bodies. Mimi and I drink herbal tea.)\n\nI sat down at my place at the kitchen table. A few moments later, Mom joined me, then Janine, and then my father. Mimi served up the scrambled eggs she'd made, and sat down next to me.\n\n\"This is lovely, Mother,\" said my mom to Mimi. \"Honestly, I don't know what we'd do without you.\"\n\n\"Me, neither!\" I added.\n\n\"And I do not know what I would do if I did not have you to take care of,\" said Mimi earnestly.\n\nMimi has been living with us since before I was born. My grandfather, Mimi's husband, died not long after my mom and dad got married.",

          "text": "\"The members of the Baby\u2011sitters Club were all going over to the new home of Kristy Thomas, our club president. She and her mother and brothers had moved there not long ago when her mother got remarried to Watson Brewer, this really nice guy who also happens to be a really rich guy. He lives in a neighborhood where the yards are big enough for swimming pools or tennis courts, and all the houses are set way back from the road. Some of them are hidden by walls or bushes.\n\nUntil she moved, though, Kristy had lived in a regular old house on regular old Bradford Court, next door to her best friend, Mary Anne Spier, who's our club secretary, and across the street from Claudia Kishi, our vice president and my best friend. It was Kristy's idea to start a business doing baby\u2011sitting for the families in our neighborhood, and it worked out really well. The four of us, plus Dawn Schafer, who lives not far away, meet for about a half an hour three afternoons a week in Claudia's bedroom. Our clients phone us looking for baby\u2011sitters and they almost always get one, since they reach five sitters (I should say, five qualified sitters) at once.\n\nWe have a record book with all sorts of information, including our schedules, and Mary Anne keeps track of our jobs and who's available to sit when, and things like that. Kristy insists that we also keep the Baby\u2011sitters Club Notebook, in which each of us has to write up every single sitting job we do. Then the book gets passed around so the others can read about what happened. It's pretty useful.\n\nThis summer, our club branched out a little. Last month, July, we did our regular baby\u2011sitting and held a play group. We held it right here in my backyard. The neighborhood kids came over three mornings a week for games and stories and art projects. It worked out really well.\n\nBut July was over. It was the beginning of August. And for the first time since the club began almost a year ago, at the beginning of seventh grade, we baby\u2011sitters were going to be scattered, split up. Before that happened, Kristy wanted to have a get\u2011together. And she wanted to have it at her new house. That was fine with the rest of us. We love Watson's house, even though it makes us a little nervous sometimes.\"\n",

I wanted to be casual enough to have fun, but sophisticated enough to look impressive in case any rich neighbors dropped by. I also wanted to be cool since it felt like it was about 150 degrees outside. I changed my mind six times before I decided on this new pink shirt I got the last time we went back to New York City to visit friends. Big, bright green and yellow birds were splashed all over it. It was gigantic, so it would be cool. I put it on with a pair of baggy shorts, looped a wide green belt around my middle, and hunted up some jewelry\u2014silver bangle bracelets and a pair of silver earrings shaped like bells that actually ring when they dangle back and forth.\n\nI'm working on making Mom and Dad let me get my ears pierced a second time so I can wear two pairs of earrings at once, but so far, no luck. I pretty much grew up in New York\u2014we just moved here to Stoneybrook, Connecticut, a year ago\u2014and I have sort of wild taste. My parents have let me get away with a lot of things fashion-wise, but they draw the line at two earrings in each ear. They said I would look like a pirate, although I, personally, have never seen a pirate with more than exactly one earring. I pointed out that if I did get my ears pierced again, probably no one would mistake me for a pirate, but Mom and Dad failed to see the humor in that.\n\nBeep! Beep!\n\nI heard honking and looked out my window. The Kishis' car was in my driveway. Mr. Kishi was at the wheel; Mimi, Claudia's grandmother, was next to him; and Claudia was in the backseat with Mary Anne Spier.\n\n\"I'll be right there!\" I shouted.\n\nI thundered down the stairs.\"\n",

But Wood Acres could be our house and barn. And the secret passage would be the perfect hiding place. Anyway, listen to this. The second time I went in the passage, I was with Jeff, and he found an Indian-head nickel. You know what that is?\"\n\nMary Anne nodded.\n\n\"I know it wasn't there before. And while we were in the passage, we heard all these weird sounds, moaning and stuff.\"\n\n\"You did?\"\n\n\"Yes. And when we were in again just now, I looked everywhere for the nickel and it wasn't there.\"\n\n\"You didn't take it out of the passage?\"\n\n\"Well, I did. I mean, someone did, but I threw it back.\" I told her about the Trip-Man.\n\n\"Did you put the locks on like he suggested?\" Mary Anne wanted to know.\n\n\"Only on the entrance to my room,\" I said. \"And I only lock it at night. We couldn't figure out a way to lock the trapdoor, so we just set a bale of hay on top of it.\"\n\n\"Anyway,\" I went on, \"the peanut shells weren't in the passage before. They just appeared. And no living person has been in this passage except you, Jeff, and me!\"\n\nMary Anne nodded. Then suddenly she stiffened.\n\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\nWe didn't even have to keep quiet to hear it. The next sound was loud enough to wake the dead.\n\nTHUMP.\n\nIt definitely came from the secret passage.\n\nMary Anne started to scream, but I clapped my hand over her mouth. I didn't want Jared to hear us.\n\nThe thump was followed by another thump, then nothing.\n\nWhen the passage had been quiet for ten entire minutes, I jumped up. \"I'm going back in there!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Not me,\" said Mary Anne. \"See you later.\" But she must have felt guilty because a moment later she added, \"I'll guard the entrance for you.\"\n\nI took my flashlight, marched into the passage, and kept going. At the bottom of the stairs, I screamed. Lying at my feet was a book. It was called Great Dog Tales. It looked about a hundred years old. I had never seen it before in my life.

          "text": "Tuesday\n\nThe Pikes strike again! Today I baby-sat for Nicky, Vanessa, Claire, and Margo. Since just the four of them were there, Mrs. Pike decided she needed only one sitter. Believe me, I could have used ten or twelve more. Vanessa and Margo did something to Claire I will never, ever be able to forget. To top it off, Nicky disappeared. I didn't worry at first, but when he didn't turn up after almost an hour, I got nervous. I'm sure he breaks that two-block rule, but I can't prove it. Anyway, get a load of what the girls did.\n\nOh, boy. Am l glad I wasn't sitting at the Pikes' that day. As it was, I got called in to look for Nicky, but Stacey sure had her hands full with the girls, even before she knew Nicky was gone.\n\nIt started when the mail arrived. Usually, the mail in our neighborhood is delivered just before lunch, but that day it was late. The mail truck pulled up at the Pikes' at about three o'clock in the afternoon.\n\n\"I'll get it!\" cried Vanessa. She tore out the door with Claire and Margo at her heels. Nicky was on the sun porch, alone as usual, reading a book.\n\nStacey took advantage of the quiet to start in on the list of chores Mrs. Pike had left her. (Sometimes, if Mr. and Mrs. Pike are behind with the housework, us baby-sitters pitch in with the laundry and stuff, and then we earn mother's helpers wages, which are better than plain old baby-sitters wages.)\n\nStacey got into the rhythm of folding clean clothes and folded two basketsful. Then she moved on to the kitchen, where she unloaded the clean dishes in the dishwasher and loaded up the dirty ones.\n\nThe house was quiet. Stacey sighed contentedly. She checked on Nicky. He was still reading on the porch. She thought she remembered hearing the girls come in.\n\n\"Vanessa?\" she called. \"Claire? Margo?\"\n\n\"We're upstairs!\" Vanessa shouted back.\n\n\"Okay!\"\n\nStacey returned to her chores.\n\nFifteen minutes later, things were still quiet. Quiet wasn't unusual for Nicky those days, but it was for the girls. Three girls generally make some sort of noise, but Stacey hadn't heard so much as a giggle.\n\nShe started up the stairs \u2014 and that was when the thing came flying down at her. It was little and shrieked and had a head of white foam. When it collided with Stacey, it left foam all over her Hawaiian shirt.\n\n\"Yikes!\" cried Stacey. She backed against the wall.\n\nThe foam-thing was rubbing at its eyes. It stumbled forward and Stacey caught it before it fell down the stairs.\n\n\"Claire!\" Stacey exclaimed. \"Is that you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" wailed the foam-thing. \"It's (gulp) meeeeeee!\"\n\nStacey glanced at the top of the stairs. Margo and Vanessa were standing there solemnly, looking down at their little sister. Stacey said later that that's when she first thought something was really wrong. If the older girls had pulled some sort of prank, they would have been laughing hysterically at the sight of the foam. But they were as somber and silent as rocks.\n\n\"Margo? Vanessa?\" Stacey said. She steadied Claire and began to lead her upstairs.\n\n\"It's not our fault!\" Margo cried. \"Really.\"\n\n\"Honest,\" added Vanessa, wide-eyed. \"Don't blame us.\" She was so upset, she forgot to rhyme her words.\n\nStacey made a huge effort to control her temper. \"What happened?\" she asked.\n\nNobody said a word.\n\n\"Claire?\" Stacey peered into Claire's face, wiping away some foam.\n\n\"Shampoo,\" Claire managed to reply.\n\n\"Shampoo? Is that all?\" said Stacey, suddenly feeling better. \"You guys tried to give your sister a shampoo? Well, what's wrong with that? It was very thoughtful. I just wish you'd asked me first. Come on, Claire. All we have to do is wash it out.\"\n\nStill the girls remained quiet. Stacey noticed that the foam was unlike any she'd",

Cabbage, blood, people who chew with their mouths open, and squirrels are a few of them. But snobs are way up there on the list.\n\nThis is unfortunate since I have moved to a wealthy neighborhood here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, recently, and it is overrun with snobs. What happened was that my mom, who used to be divorced, got remarried to Watson Brewer, this rich guy. Since my mom had a little house for the six of us (Mom, me, my three brothers, and our dog, Louie), and Watson had this mansion all to himself (his two kids only live with him every other weekend), it made more sense for us Thomases to move in with Watson than for him to move in with us.\n\nSo we did.\n\nWatson's house is so big that my brothers and I, and Karen and Andrew (our stepsister and stepbrother, who live with us every other weekend), each have a room of our own. Mom and Watson share a room, of course, but their \"room\" is really a suite about the size of a landing field.\n\nAnyway, to get back to the snobs \u2014 I'm surrounded. They're everywhere in Watson's neighborhood. The teenagers around here get their own cars (fancy ones) as soon as they're able to drive. They spin along with the radios blaring, looking fresh and sophisticated. I am so glad my big brothers, Sam and Charlie, aren't like that. Charlie can drive now, but the only thing he drives is Mom's beat-up station wagon. And my brothers and I still go to public school, not to snobby private schools. Guess what most families on our street have: (a) a swimming pool (b) tennis courts (c) a cook named Agnes (d) all of the above. The answer is (d) all of the above.\n\nSo far, Watson has (e) none of the above, which is one of the things I'm learning to like about him. However, he's been talking about putting in a pool, now that Karen and Andrew are older, so we'll see.\n\nI've hardly gotten to know any of the kids here. When we first moved into Watson's house it was summertime, the beginning of July. Most of the kids my age had been sent to fancy camps for the summer. (I would kill Mom if she ever did that to me.) Plus, I'm president of a group called the Baby-sitters Club. All my friends are in the club, and they live way across town \u2014 where I used to live \u2014 so I spent a lot of time with them over in my old neighborhood last summer. What I'm trying to say is that school had started again before I met any of the kids on my street.",

I rolled over and tried to ignore it.\n\n\"Please, please be quiet,\" I mumbled.\n\nBut the clock didn't obey. It went right on buzzing.\n\n\"Oh, all right, you win,\" I told it.\n\nI reached over and shut it off, then sat up, rubbing my eyes.\n\n\"Louie!\" I exclaimed. Our old collie was stretched across the foot of my big bed. Louie mostly sleeps with David Michael, but lately, he's been taking turns sleeping with all of us, even Karen and Andrew on the weekends they visit. I thought it was nice of Louie to share himself.\n\n\"You are such a good dog,\" I whispered, leaning over to him. I stroked the top of his head between his ears. The fur there is almost as soft as rabbit fur. Then I took one of his paws in my hand.\n\n\"Oh, your pads are cold,\" I told him, rubbing the pink pads on the bottom of his paw. \"It must be getting chilly at night. Poor old Louie.\"\n\nLouie licked my hand and gave me a doggie smile.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said.\n\nI got up and looked through my closet, as if I had a really big decision to make about what to wear. Ever since school began I've been wearing the same kind of outfit almost every day \u2014 a turtleneck, a sweater, jeans, and sneakers. I don't care about clothes the way my friends Claudia and Stacey do. They always look really cool and put-together.",

(David Michael, my seven-year-old brother, is a slowpoke. He's always the last one down.)\n\nHere's another thing about Watson that's not so bad. He helps out around the house \u2014 with the cooking, cleaning, gardening, everything. I guess this comes from being divorced and having lived alone for a while before he met Mom. He and Mom share the workload equally. They both have jobs, they both prepare meals (Watson is actually a better cook than Mom is), they both run errands, etc. Twice a week, a cleaning lady comes in, and my brothers and I are responsible for certain chores, but basically Mom and Watson run the show.\n\nSo I wasn't surprised when I stepped into the kitchen that Monday morning to find Mom making coffee and Watson scrambling eggs. Sam was setting the table and Charlie was pouring orange juice. It was a nice familiar scene.\n\n\"Good morning!\" I said.\n\n\"Morning,\" everyone replied.\n\n\"Kristy, can't you wear something different once in a while?\" Sam asked me, eyeing my jeans and sweater.\n\n\"Why do you care what I wear?\" I replied, but I knew perfectly well why he cared. He cared because he was fifteen and girls were practically the only thing on his mind. He thought he was the girl expert of the world, and he was disappointed in my lack of fashion sense. Plus, he was interested in this tr\u00e8s sophisticated girl down the street (one of the private\u2011school girls) and he wanted everything about our family to be up to Monique's standards, which were sky\u2011high.\n\n\"I think Kristy looks lovely,\" said Watson.\n\n\"So do I,\" added Mom, kissing the top of my head.\n\n\"But,\" Watson went on, \"if you ever do want a few, um, new clothes, all you have to do is holler.\"\n\nIt was a nice offer, but leave it to Watson to use a word like \"holler.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said. \"I'll remember that.\"\n\nI absolutely adore Watson's kitchen. Although it has all the modern conveniences and appliances, it looks kind of like an old country kitchen. We eat at a big parson's table with two long",

          "text": "It was the last day of summer vacation. I couldn't believe more than two months had sped by since the end of seventh grade. One day the weather had been fresh and cool with the promise of summer and fun, and now it was stale and hot with the promise of autumn and school. Tomorrow my friends and I would become eighth\u2011graders. An awful lot had happened over the summer. In fact, it had been a more eventful summer than usual. Something important had happened to every single member of the Baby\u2011sitters Club.\n\nI guess that, first of all, I should tell you what the Baby\u2011sitters Club is, in case you don't know. The club consists of me (I'm Mary Anne Spier) and my friends Kristy Thomas, Dawn Schafer, Claudia Kishi, and Stacey McGill. The five of us run a business, which Kristy started. We baby\u2011sit for the kids in our neighborhoods, and we have a lot of fun \u2014 and earn pretty much money, too. We meet three times a week to take calls from people who need baby\u2011sitters, and also sometimes to gossip and fool around. But we're very professional about the way we run our business.\n\nAnyway, here's what happened to us over the summer. I'll start with Kristy, since she's the president of the club, and since her event was the biggest and most exciting of all. Her mother got married again and Kristy was her bridesmaid! Honest. She wore a long dress and her first pair of shoes with heels. Claudia and Dawn and Stacey and I were guests at the wedding. And then Kristy and her family (her two older brothers Sam and Charlie, and her little brother David Michael) moved out of their old house, which was next door to mine, and across town to her stepfather's mansion. Kristy's really got a good deal in her new place \u2014 she has anything she wants (within reason) plus built\u2011in baby\u2011sitting charges. Andrew and Karen, her little stepbrother and stepsister, spend every other weekend (and some in\u2011between time, too) at Watson's. Watson is Kristy's stepfather.\n\nThen there's Claudia Kishi. Claudia is the vice president of our club. We always hold our meetings in her room, since she has her own phone and even her own private phone number. Claudia's summer event was the saddest of all, but it has a happy ending. Her grandmother Mimi (who lives with the Kishis, and who's a favorite of the Baby\u2011sitters Club) had a stroke one night in July. She had to stay in the hospital for a long time and she still has to have physical therapy, but she's getting better. She can walk and talk, and someday (maybe) she'll be able to use her right hand a little more.\n\nDawn Schafer is my new best friend. She's the official alternate officer of the club, which means she can take over the duties of anyone who has to miss a meeting. Her family used to live in California, but her parents got divorced, so her mother moved Dawn and her younger brother Jeff all the way across country to Stoneybrook, Connecticut. Claudia and Kristy and I grew up here, but New England has been kind of an adjustment for Dawn. Anyway, over the summer, Dawn and Jeff got to fly to California to visit their father, and (after they'd come back) Dawn discovered a secret passage in the old farmhouse she lives in!\n\nThe fourth member of the club is Stacey McGill. She's our treasurer, and also sort of a newcomer to Stoneybrook. She moved here exactly one year ago from big, glamorous, exciting New York City. Stacey, by the way, is sort of glamorous and exciting herself. That's why she and Claudia are best friends. They\u2019re both sophisticated and love wearing flashy clothes and weird jewelry and doing things to their hair. The two of them really stand out in a crowd, and I've always been envious of them.\n\nAnyway, Stacey's summer excitement was mine, too. We got jobs as mother's helpers with one of the families we sit for and went with them to the beach \u2014 Sea City, New Jersey. We stayed in Sea City for two weeks and not only had a great time, but found boys we liked! I guess that wasn't such a big deal for Stacey, but it was a big deal for me. I'm kind of shy and tend to be on the quiet side. I'd never been very interested in boys, either. This wasn't because I didn't like them; it was because I was afraid of them. I used to think, What do you say to a boy? Then I realized you can talk to a boy the same way you talk to a girl. You just have to choose your topics more carefully. Obviously, with a boy, you can't talk about bras or cute guys you see on TV, but you can talk about school and movies and animals and sports (if you know anything about sports).\n\nWhen Stacey and I were in Sea City, Stacey started out by being a real pain. She fell in luv (as she always writes it) with this gorgeous lifeguard who was years too old for her, and left me on my own. With no one my age around, I started talking to this nice\u2011looking boy who was hanging around on the beach because he was a mother's helper, too. We really hit it off. We talked about lots of things, and by the time I had to leave Sea City, we had exchanged rings with our initials on them. We bought them on the boardwalk. I don't know if we'll really write to each other (as we promised), but it's nice to know boys aren't aliens from the planet Snorzak or something.",

It was almost time for our last Baby\u2011sitters Club meeting of the summer.\n\n\"Coming!\" I called.\n\nI ran out of my bedroom, down the stairs, and through the hall to the front door. I peeped through the window. Dawn was standing on the steps. She sometimes comes to my house before a meeting, and then we walk over to Claudia's together.\n\n\"Hi!\" she greeted me. Dawn was fussing with her hair. She has the longest hair of anyone I know. It's even longer than Claudia's. And it's pale, pale blonde. Dawn was wearing a pretty snappy outfit \u2014 hot\u2011pink shorts with a big, breezy island\u2011print shirt over a white tank top.\n\n\"Hi,\" I replied. \"You look really terrific.

Cabbage, blood, people who chew with their mouths open, and squirrels are a few of them. But snobs are way up there on the list.\n\nThis is unfortunate since I have moved to a wealthy neighborhood here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, recently, and it is overrun with snobs. What happened was that my mom, who used to be divorced, got remarried to Watson Brewer, this rich guy. Since my mom had a little house for the six of us (Mom, me, my three brothers, and our dog, Louie), and Watson had this mansion all to himself (his two kids only live with him every other weekend), it made more sense for us Thomases to move in with Watson than for him to move in with us.\n\nSo we did.\n\nWatson\u2019s house is so big that my brothers and I, and Karen and Andrew (our stepsister and stepbrother, who live with us every other weekend), each have a room of our own. Mom and Watson share a room, of course, but their \u201croom\u201d is really a suite about the size of a landing field.\n\nAnyway, to get back to the snobs \u2014 I\u2019m surrounded. They\u2019re everywhere in Watson\u2019s neighborhood. The teenagers around here get their own cars (fancy ones) as soon as they\u2019re able to drive. They spin along with the radios blaring, looking fresh and sophisticated. I am so glad my big brothers, Sam and Charlie, aren\u2019t like that. Charlie can drive now, but the only thing he drives is Mom\u2019s beat\u2011up station wagon. And my brothers and I still go to public school, not to snobby private schools. Guess what most families on our street have: (a) a swimming pool (b) tennis courts (c) a cook named Agnes (d) all of the above. The answer is (d) all of the above.\n\nSo far, Watson has (e) none of the above, which is one of the things I\u2019m learning to like about him. However, he\u2019s been talking about putting in a pool, now that Karen and Andrew are older, so we\u2019ll see.\n\nI\u2019ve hardly gotten to know any of the kids here.",

          "text": "My first encounter with the snobby kids was on a Monday morning. My alarm clock went off at 6:45 as usual. I rolled over and tried to ignore it.\n\n\u201cPlease, please be quiet,\u201d I mumbled.\n\nBut the clock didn\u2019t obey. It went right on buzzing.\n\n\u201cOh, all right, you win,\u201d I told it.\n\nI reached over and shut it off, then sat up, rubbing my eyes.\n\n\u201cLouie!\u201d I exclaimed. Our old collie was stretched across the foot of my big bed. Louie mostly sleeps with David Michael, but lately, he\u2019s been taking turns sleeping with all of us, even Karen and Andrew on the weekends they visit. I thought it was nice of Louie to share himself.\n\n\u201cYou are such a good dog,\u201d I whispered, leaning over to him. I stroked the top of his head between his ears. The fur there is almost as soft as rabbit fur. Then I took one of his paws in my hand.\n\n\u201cOh, your pads are cold,\u201d I told him, rubbing the pink pads on the bottom of his paw. \u201cIt must be getting chilly at night. Poor old Louie.\u201d\n\nLouie licked my hand and gave me a doggie smile.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said.\n\nI got up and looked through my closet, as if I had a really big decision to make about what to wear. Ever since school began I\u2019ve been wearing the same kind of outfit almost every day \u2014 a turtleneck, a sweater, jeans, and sneakers. I don\u2019t care about clothes the way my friends Claudia and Stacey do. They always look really cool and put\u2011together.\n\nAfter I was washed and dressed, I ran down the wide staircase to the first floor and into the kitchen. Mom and Watson were with Sam and Charlie. (David Michael, my seven\u2011year\u2011old brother, is a slowpoke. He\u2019s always the last one down.)\n\nHere\u2019s another thing about Watson that\u2019s not so bad. He helps out around the house \u2014 with the cooking, cleaning, gardening, everything. I guess this comes from being divorced and having lived alone for a while before he met Mom. He and Mom share the workload equally. They both have jobs, they both prepare meals (Watson is actually a better cook than Mom is), they both run errands, etc. Twice a week, a cleaning lady comes in, and my brothers and I are responsible for certain chores, but basically Mom and Watson run the show.\n\nSo I wasn\u2019t surprised when I stepped into the kitchen that Monday morning to find Mom making coffee and Watson scrambling eggs. Sam was setting the table and Charlie was pouring orange juice. It was a nice familiar scene.\n\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d everyone replied.\n\n\u201cKristy, can\u2019t you wear something different once in a while?\u201d Sam asked me, eyeing my jeans and sweater.\n\n\u201cWhy do you care what I wear?\u201d I replied, but I knew perfectly well why he cared. He cared because he was fifteen and girls were practically the only thing on his mind. He thought he was the girl expert of the world, and he was disappointed in my lack of fashion sense. Plus, he was interested in this tr\u00e8s sophisticated girl down the street (one of the private\u2011school girls) and he wanted everything about our family to be up to Monique\u2019s standards, which were sky\u2011high.\n\n\u201cI think Kristy looks lovely,\u201d said Watson.\n\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d added Mom, kissing the top of my head.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Watson went on, \u201cif you ever do want a few, um, new clothes, all you have to do is holler.\u201d\n\nIt was a nice offer, but leave it to Watson to use a word like \u201choller.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201d\n\nI absolutely adore Watson\u2019s kitchen. Although it has all the modern conveniences and appliances, it looks kind of like an old country kitchen. We eat at a big parson\u2019s table with two long",

This gives us a pretty wide selection of books (and some of them are an awful lot shorter than The Yearling), but the thing is I just don't like to read. Except for Nancy Drew mysteries. They're fun. And I'm a pretty good sleuth.\n\nMrs. Hall was talking about From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler and The Westing Game. Okay, I'll admit it. I hadn't gotten around to reading either one, even though there is a character in Mixed-up Files with my name \u2014 Claudia. In fact, the only Newbery Award-winner I had read so far was this one called Sarah, Plain and Tall. That was because it was just fifty-eight pages long.\n\n\"Claudia?\" said Mrs. Hall.\n\n\"Yes?\" (Was she just trying to get my attention or had she asked me some question?)\n\n\"Can you help us out here?\" (I guess she'd asked a question.) I could feel the blood rising to my face. I looked down at my notebook in which I'd been doodling pictures of some of the kids I baby-sit for. \"Um, with what?\" I replied.\n\nMrs. Hall sighed. \"Claudia Kishi.\" (This was not a good sign. Mrs. Hall hardly ever uses our last names.) \"Would you please pay attention?\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yes,\" I managed to reply.\n\nMrs. Hall shook her head sadly. I wanted to add, \"Sorry for ruining your day,\" because that's just what she looked like \u2014 a person whose day had been ruined. By me! I felt kind of powerful, although I wasn't proud of it. Imagine being able to ruin a grown-up's entire day single-handedly.\n\nMrs. Hall took my boredom pretty hard. \"Class, please close your books and take out a fresh piece of paper. I want to give you a spelling check.\" (\"Check\" is Mrs. Hall's term for \"surprise quiz.\")\n\nThe class groaned. A few kids directed murderous glances at me, as if this whole thing were my fault. Well, I bet I hadn't been the only one watching that fly and doodling in my notebook.\n\n\"The words,\" Mrs. Hall went on, \"will be taken from chapters seven and eight of Mixed-up Files, which you should have read last night.\"\n\n\"Should have\" is right, I thought.\n\n\"The first word,\" Mrs. Hall said, \"is 'pharaoh.'\"\n\nI waited for her to use it in a sentence (not that it would do me any good). Mrs. Hall always uses spelling words in sentences, and she pronounces the sentences very carefully, with lots of emphasis.\n\n\"The children are studying a famous Egyptian pha-raoh.\"\n\nAh-ha! I thought. Mrs. Hall was giving us a hidden clue. She used famous and pharaoh in the same sentence. They must begin with the same letter. Now, I'm a terrible speller, but I do know that famous begins with an f. Very slowly, I printed f-a-r-o on my paper. Then, thoughtfully, I erased the o and added another r. At the last moment, I tacked a w onto the end. That looked pretty good. Farrow. I was proud of myself for thinking to add one of those killer silent letters to the word. Who invented them, anyway? They're such a waste.\n\n\"'Institute,'\" Mrs. Hall went on.\n\nI barely heard her. Outside the window, our varsity cheerleaders were practicing for our upcoming game against Stamford Junior High. They were really good. I wished I could do a split. Then I remembered what I was supposed to be doing, and scribbled instatute on my paper. Not a moment too soon.\n\n\"'Quarterly.'\"\n\nBefore Mrs. Hall could use quarterly in one of her emphatic sentences, the door to our classroom opened. Every single head, including Mrs. Hall's, swiveled toward it. When we saw Ms. Downey, the school secretary, standing there, we grew really interested. The secretary only comes to a classroom for something major, otherwise the principal sends a student messenger.\n\nMrs. Hall crossed the room to Ms. Downey, and the two of them put their heads together and whispered for a moment. I hate when grownups do that. Then they pulled apart, and Ms. Downey stepped back and showed someone else into the room. Mrs. Hall greeted her warmly. \"Hello, Ashley,\" she said, smiling. \"We're happy to have you.\"\n\nThen Ms. Downey handed Mrs. Hall some papers and left.",

The club is really a sitting business that I run with four of my friends.\n\n'Stacey! Stacey!' someone called.\n\nI turned around, trying to open my locker at the same time. 'Oh, hi, Claud!' I replied.\n\nClaudia Kishi is my best friend here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. (I have another best friend, Laine Cummings, in New York City, which is where I used to live.)

I'm supposed to be at her house by three.... What did you hear?'\n\n'That Howie Johnson asked Dorianne Wallingford to go to the library with him this afternoon.'\n\nI frowned. Howie wasn't exactly my boyfriend. In fact, he wasn't my boyfriend at all. But he had taken me to the last few school dances. So why was he asking Dori to study with him?\n\n'Maybe they're doing a group project together or something,' I suggested. But I was far more hurt than I let on, even though there was no reason to feel that way.\n\n'Yeah. That must be it.' Claudia slipped her arm comfortingly across my shoulders. 'Come on. I'll walk you to Charlotte's. And then I'll see you at the club meeting later.'\n\nClaudia left me at the Johanssens' driveway.

As soon as Dr. Johanssen left, Charlotte began talking again. Sometimes I just couldn't over how she had changed since I first baby-sat for her. That was a year ago, when she was seven. She was quiet then, and sad, and had no friends her age. Now she's happy and friendly and has a new best girlfriend each week. Her mother says half the change is due to the fact that Charlotte wasn't being challenged enough at school and needed to skip a grade (which she did) \u2014 and the other half is due to me! According to Dr. Johanssen, I helped Charlotte learn a lot about herself and about getting along with kids. That makes me feel terrific. Also, it's kind of nice to be somebody's favorite person.

(Kristy is full of ideas.) The sign of a good businessperson, my dad always says, is the ability to recognize a problem and find a way to solve it (a money-making way to solve it, that is). And that's exactly what Kristy did a year ago. She saw what a hard time her mother was having trying to find a sitter for her little brother, David Michael. Her mom had to make one call after another, looking for someone who was free. What Kristy thought was, wouldn't it be great if her mom could find a sitter with just one phone call? And now our club provides that service. When somebody calls Claudia's number on a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday afternoon between 5:30 and 6:00, they reach Claudia (of course), Kristy, Mary Anne Spier, Dawn Schafer, and me, Stacey McGill.\n\nWe are the members of the Baby-sitters Club.\n\nAs I've said, Kristy is the president and Claudia is the vice president.

          "text": "Spectacles. Eyeglasses. Bifocals. Trifocals. No matter what you call them, glasses are glasses, and I have to wear them.\n\nHello. I'm Mallory Pike. I'm eleven. Apart from the glasses, this is the thing you need to know about me: I have seven younger brothers and sisters. That's right, seven. And three of them are triplets, identical boys. If you think it's easy to blend in when you come from an eight-kid family, wear glasses, and furthermore are the only one you know with a head of curly hair, you're wrong.\n\nThe triplets are ten years old. Their names are Adam, Jordan, and Byron. Occasionally, they make me crazy, but mostly they're all right. The good thing about triplets is that they always have each other. Built-in friends.\n\nThe next kid in my family is Vanessa. Vanessa is nine and hopes to become a poet. Sometimes she goes around for days on end speaking in rhyme. Talk about making me crazy. But Vanessa is all right, too, and in a lot of ways we're very much alike.\n\nMy eight-year-old brother is Nicky. I feel kind of sorry for Nicky because he has trouble making a place for himself in our family. He wants to play with the triplets most of the time, since they're boys, but the triplets think Nicky is a baby. That leaves Nicky with us girls, and Nicky is going through this phase where he hates girls.\n\nMargo is seven. She's going through a bossy phase, even though she's almost the youngest in the family. She bosses everyone and everything, even my parents, her dolls, and Pow, this dog that lives down the street. It's always \"Do this,\" and \"Do that.\" Mostly, we ignore her. I mean we ignore the bossiness, not Margo herself.\n\nLast in our family is Claire. Claire is five. I guess being the baby in a big family isn't always easy, but you'd think she wouldn't exactly need to draw attention to herself. That's just what Claire does, though, by being extremely silly. Over the summer, she started calling our parents Moozie and Daggles instead of Mommy and Daddy, and she attaches \"silly-billy-goo-goo\" to people's names. Like, if she wants a drink, she'll say, \"Can I have some juice, Mallory-silly-billy-goo-goo?\" Sometimes she'll add, \"Puh-lease, puh-lease, with a cherry on top?\" It's annoying, but at least she doesn't do it as often as she used to. Besides, Claire is huggable and affectionate, so it's easy to overlook the \"silly-billy-goo-goo\" stuff.\n\nThen there are my parents. My mom doesn't have a job. I mean, a job outside of the house, like being a doctor or an insurance salesperson or something. She says us kids are her job, and that with eight of us it's a big job.\n\nMy dad is a lawyer, but not the kind you see on TV, making wild speeches in a crowded courtroom. He's what's called a corporate lawyer. He's the lawyer for a big company in Stamford, Connecticut. (We live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, which isn't far away.) Mostly, he sits at a desk or attends meetings. Once in awhile, though, he does go to court, but I bet he doesn't make speeches. I think he just stands up a lot and says, \"Objection!\" and things like that.\n\nEvery single one of us Pikes, even my parents, has dark brown hair (Mom calls it \"chestnut brown\" to make it seem less ordinary) and blue eyes. Nicky and Vanessa and I wear glasses (all the time \u2014 not just for reading, unfortunately), but as I mentioned earlier, I am the only one with curly hair. I'm also the only one with freckles across my nose. I really stick out. If only Mom would let me get contacts. But she won't. Not until I'm fifteen. And she won't let me get my ears pierced until I'm thirteen.\n\nBeing eleven is a real trial.\n\nI will admit one thing, though: No matter what age you are, being the oldest of eight kids sure teaches you responsibility. And it taught me a lot about baby-sitting. I love sitting, even though I haven't done much of it on my own yet. But guess what? These girls I know asked me if I'd be interested in joining their baby-sitting club! And they're not just any girls, they're older girls! No kidding. There are four of them and they live in my neighborhood. (Well, most of them do.) Their names are Kristy Thomas, Claudia Kishi, Mary Anne Spier, and Dawn Schafer. They used to have a fifth member, Stacey McGill, but she moved away. That's why the girls need me \u2014 to take Stacey's place. The way they know me is that they sit for our family all the time. Although lately, instead of being sat for, I've helped with the sitting. And as I said, I know a lot about kids.\n\nI am so flattered that the girls want me to join their club. But I'm nervous, too. What if they decide I'm not good enough or not grown-up enough or something? Oh, well. I'll know on Monday. That's when I go to my first club meeting.\n\nRight now it's Saturday. Two days to wait. But I've got plenty to do. I'm reading three books \u2014 Dr. Dolittle, The Incredible Journey, and this really funny one called Freaky Friday. I love to read, and I don't believe that you have to finish one book before you start another. I like to write, too. I keep journals, and I write stories, stories, stories. Sometimes I illustrate them.\n\nPlus, this afternoon, I have to baby-sit. In fact, I better go downstairs now. Dad is taking the triplets to the barber for haircuts, and Mom is taking Margo and Vanessa shopping for sneakers. That leaves me in charge of Nicky and Claire. I guess I'm lucky that my parents pay me for taking care of my own brothers and sisters.",

She and Mary Anne used to do a lot of baby\u2011sitting in their neighborhood, and Kristy realized that any time a parent needed a sitter, he or she had to make about a zillion phone calls trying to find someone who was free. She thought, \"Wouldn't it be great if a parent could make one call and reach a whole bunch of sitters at once?\" So she got a group of friends together to form the club, and now we meet three times a week \u2014 Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons from 5:30 until 6:00. Our clients know about our meetings (we advertise), and they call us while we're holding them. There are six members of the club now, and usually at least one of us is free and can take any job that comes in. Great for the parent (only one call to make, plus we are responsible, trustworthy sitters). And great for us (we each get lots of jobs, have fun, and earn money).\n\nWe run our club very professionally. We sitters are always on time, we make sure we know important information, such as where the parents will be and when the children should go to bed, and we're just plain great with kids. We love them! We have a club record book in which Mary Anne keeps track of our clients and appointments (she's the secretary), and I keep track of the money we earn (I'm the treasurer). We also have a club notebook, which is like a diary. (Kristy makes us keep it up\u2011to\u2011date.) In it, we each write up every job we go on, and then we're supposed to read the entries about once a week. That way, we know what's going on with the kids the other club members have taken care of.",

As she says, her mouth gets her in trouble sometimes. When Kristy first started the club she lived right across the street from Claudia and next door to Mary Anne. She and Mary Anne had been best friends all their lives. Then last summer Kristy's mom, who had been divorced, married Watson Brewer, a really rich guy. Watson moved Kristy and her family across town to his mansion. Kristy has three brothers \u2014 Charlie, who's seventeen; Sam, who's fifteen; and David Michael, who's just seven. Now she also has a stepsister and stepbrother. They're Watson's kids. Karen is six and Andrew is four. Kristy likes her new family, but it represents a big change for her and she has a lot to get used to. Luckily, Charlie drives her to and from club meetings (we pay him out of the dues money we put in our treasury each week), so Kristy doesn't have to miss out on anything just because she moved.",

Kristy couldn't care less about clothes; Claudia is a fashion nut who is always wearing the latest fad thing and looks great. She's Japanese\u2011American and has this long, silky, jet\u2011black hair; dark, almond\u2011shaped eyes; and a creamy, clear complexion. She loves art and reading mysteries, but she's not a very good student. Which is too bad because her older sister, Janine, is a genius.

Kristy thinks boys were put on this planet to torture her, Mary Anne is the only one of us with a steady boyfriend. (Her boyfriend, by the way, is Logan Bruno, one of our club's associate members. That means that Logan is someone we can call on if a job comes in that none of us is free to take. Our other associate member is a girl named Shannon Kilbourne, who lives across the street from Kristy.) Although Mary Anne didn't used to care about clothes, lately she's been taking more of an interest in them and she's been looking good. One thing about the two best friends that's the same is their appearance. They're both small for their age and have brown hair and brown eyes. Mary Anne lives with her dad and her kitten, Tigger.

My family and I had only been living in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, for a few weeks at that time....\n\nI woke up before my alarm went off. I've always been able to do that. But for some reason, I always set it anyway. Just in case I should have a mental lapse and not wake up on time. The reason I get up early is so that I can practice my ballet.\n\nEvery morning, I wake up at 5:29, hit the alarm before it can off and wake everyone else up, chuck my nightgown, and put on my leotard and warm\u2011up stuff. Then I tiptoe down to the basement. No matter how quiet I am, I know Mama always wakes up and listens to me make my way to the basement. That's just the kind of mother she is. I hope she goes back to sleep after she sees that everything is as it should be. But I'll probably never know. Even though she and I are very close (which is how I know she wakes up when I do), I'll probably never ask if she goes back to sleep, and she probably doesn't know that I know she wakes up. It's not the kind of thing you need to talk about.",

          "text": "The barre in the basement is one of the nice things about moving to Stoneybrook. As I mentioned earlier, we haven't lived here very long. In fact, until we moved, we had lived in a little house on a little street in Oakley, New Jersey. I was born there. Well, not in the house \u2014 in Oakley General Hospital \u2014 but my parents were already living in the house.\n\nMaybe I should tell you a little about my family now. (I'll get back to the barre in the basement in Stoneybrook. Really, I will.) Here are the people in my family: Mama; Daddy; my eight\u2011year\u2011old sister, Becca (short for Rebecca); my baby brother, Squirt (whose real name is John Philip Ramsey, Jr.); and me \u2014 Jessi Ramsey. I'm eleven, and my full name is Jessica Davis Ramsey.\n\nMy family is black.\n\nI know it sounds funny to announce it like that. If we were white, I wouldn't have to, because you would probably assume we were white. But when you're a minority, things are different.\n\nOf course, if you could see me, there wouldn't be any question that I'm black. I have skin the color of cocoa \u2014 darkish cocoa \u2014 soft black hair, and eyes like two pieces of coal. That's how dark brown they are. They're the darkest brown eyes I have ever seen. My sister Becca looks like a miniature version of me, except that her eyes aren't quite as dark. Also, she doesn't have my long, long legs. Maybe that's why she's not a dancer. (Or maybe it's because of her stage fright.) And Squirt looks like, well, a baby. That's really all you can say about him. He's only fourteen months old. (By the way, he got his nickname from the nurses in Oakley General because he was the smallest baby in the hospital. Even now, he's a little on the small side, but he makes up for it by being extremely bright.)\n\nAs I said, we used to live in Oakley. I liked Oakley a lot. In our neighborhood were both black families and white families. (Our street was all black.) And Oakley Elementary was mixed black and white. So was my dancing school. My grandparents and a whole bunch of my cousins and aunts and uncles lived nearby. (My best friend was my cousin Keisha. We have the same birthday.)\n\nThen Daddy's company said they were going to give him a big raise and a big promotion. That was great, of course. The only thing was that they also wanted to move him to the Stamford, Connecticut, branch of the company. That's how we ended up here in Stoneybrook. The company found this house for us in this little town. My parents like small towns (Oakley is pretty small), and Daddy's drive to Stamford each morning isn't long at all.\n\nBut \u2014 I don't think any of us expected the one bad thing we found in Stoneybrook: There are hardly any black families here. We're the only black family in our neighborhood, and I am \u2014 get this \u2014 the only black kid in the whole entire sixth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. Can you believe it? I can't.\n\nUnfortunately, things have been a little rough for us. I can't tell if some people here really don't like black people, or if they just haven't known many, so they're kind of wary of us. But they sure weren't very nice at first. Things are getting better, though. (Slowly.)\n\nThings started getting better for me when I met Mallory Pike. I think she's going to be my new best friend. (Actually, she is my new best friend, but I feel funny saying that \u2014 like it might hurt Keisha somehow.) Mallory is this really nice girl in my grade who's part of an eight\u2011kid family. And she got me into a group called the Baby\u2011sitters Club, which has been great.",

Our new house is so much bigger than our house in Oakley, and Daddy's job pays so much more money, that he and Mama set up this practice area in the basement for me. It's got mirrors, and a couple of mats (for warm\u2011ups), and of course, the barre.\n\nOn the morning I've been telling you about, I practiced in the basement until I heard Mama and Daddy making coffee in the kitchen.

Claudia and I had just been starting to talk about my visiting Stoneybrook for a weekend, when something happened.\n\nThe something was Judy.\n\nI don't know Judy's last name. She's the homeless woman who lives on our block. (Some people call her a bag lady.) Now I bet you're wondering about something. You've heard me mention a roach in my bedroom and a bag lady on my block. Just where in New York do I live? you're probably asking yourself. Well, I live in a very nice neighborhood on the Upper West Side. As I said before, New York roaches live everywhere \u2014 and lately, so do homeless people. Homelessness is a serious problem in New York. There are thousands and thousands of people like Judy. Some of them live in shelters or welfare hotels, some live in subway stations or railroad stations, and some actually live on the street. Judy is one of the ones who actually live on the street. She sleeps in doorways or on top of grates where warm air blows up from the subway. She gets her food from garbage cans or begs for handouts.\n\nIt is not a nice life.\n\nI see Judy at least twice a day (when I go back and forth between my nice, comfortable, doorman apartment building and my nice, comfortable private school), and I have an idea of what her life is like. Although I'm sure you can't completely understand homelessness until you've experienced it.\n\nWhat I see when I see Judy is a woman who looks a lot older than she really is. (She looks about a hundred, but Dad says she's only forty\u2011two. I don't know how he knows this.) I see a woman who owns so few things that she won't part with any of them. And I mean, she hangs onto empty tin cans, bottle caps, newspapers, and used plastic cups. She carries her stuff around in old, wrinkled, falling\u2011apart shopping bags. She's a walking dump \u2014 but that stuff we'd call trash is her life. I see a woman who is almost always hungry, who has huge sores on her legs, whose hair is matted, and whose face and hands are permanently red from being exposed to the sun, wind, heat, and cold.\n\nJudy and I couldn't be more different. Yet we're friends. Well, sort of. When Judy is in a good mood, we smile and say hello to each other. Judy calls me Missy. When she's not in a good mood, which is often \u2014 watch out! Judy will stand on the sidewalk and just shout stuff for hours. She screams and yells, then finally she quiets down and mumbles crossly. When she's in those moods, she doesn't call me Missy. She doesn't call me anything. I don't think she even recognizes me.\n\nSo what does Judy have to do with my friends' visit to New York? Well, it's like this: The people on our block who see and hear Judy everyday began to get worried about her. They decided that it was time for them, plain old ordinary citizens, to see what they could do to help Judy and other homeless people in the neighborhood. So they organized a big meeting that was to be held for an entire Saturday afternoon. Most of the adults in my building (including Mom and Dad) were eager to go. Which means that a lo",

I don't love English, but I hate math and science\n\n\"Why not get bad work done first, then do English?\" suggested Mimi.\n\nI screwed up my face. \"Okay,\" I agreed.\n\nWe began with the math. I don't know what it is about numbers. They just don't make sense to me. Stacey once said that she can \"read\" numbers the way she can read words. She understands them. She can look at a problem for a few moments, and suddenly she has the answer, without doing any figuring or writing. She calculates things in her head as if her brain were a computer.\n\nNot me. Oh, no. I sit and figure, and half the time I'm figuring wrong. Adding when I should be multiplying, subtracting four from ten and getting seven. What a mess!\n\nMimi and I plodded through my work. Mimi is so patient. She never raises her voice or gets aggravated.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, when I had finished my math and science, \"where are English plobrems, my Claudia?\"\n\nI knew she had meant to say \"problems.\" \"They're just some questions,\" I told her, \"and they're right here.\"\n\nIn English class this year we're reading the Newbery Award-winning books. We've already read several. Now we're reading Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry. I didn't think I would like it, but really, it isn't bad.\n\nMimi looked at the list of questions and read the first one. \"In what \u2014 in what ways is main \u2014 is the main character in Roll of, um, Thunder, Hear My Cry simi \u2014 similar to main \u2014 to the main character in A Wrinkle in Time?\"\n\n\"Oh, lord,\" I replied, \"They couldn't be more different! I hate questions like that.\"\n\n\"Think, my Claudia. Is anything the same about them?\"\n\n\"They're both girls,\" I said.\n\nIf Janine had been helping me, she probably would have thrown down her pencil in disgust at that answer, but Mimi just said, \"That a good start. What else?\"\n\nWe worked and worked. The more we talked, the more answers I found. When we were finally done, I kissed Mimi, thanked her, and escaped to my room.",

After awhile, I opened my box of pastels and slowly set to work. When I'm in the middle of a good project, especially a painting or a drawing, I can forget about everything else. Which is what I did. And which may explain why I jumped a mile when the phone rang.\n\n\"Hello?\" I said.\n\n\"Hi, Claudia. It's Ashley.\"\n\nAshley Wyeth is a new friend of mine. We have a funny relationship. It seems like we're always mad at each other. We're forever fighting, then making up. But Ashley is the only person who truly understands my love of art. She's a\u00a0artist herself \u2014 the most talented person our age I know. Before she moved to Stoneybrook, she lived in Chicago and went to this really great art school there. And she thinks I'm talented! Ashley can be a pain in the neck, though, because she's always bugging me to quit baby-sitting and spend more time on my art.\n\nSo when Ashley called, I braced myself for a lecture, but all she wanted was our English assignment. I read her the questions and then hung up. As soon as I did, the phone rang again.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\nAt first there was just silence at the other end of the phone. Then an odd-sounding voice said, \"Do you have Prince Albert in a can?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" I replied. \"Prince Albert?\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind.\" The voice suddenly sounded disgusted and the caller hung up.\n\nI looked at the receiver as if it could explain to me what had just happened. A goof call gone wrong, I decided as I hung up. The caller was probably someone who'd been at the film festival. Practical-joke season had begun \u2014 and I, for one, did not like it.",

She was wearing a very snazzy pair of red pants that were held up by red suspenders. Under the suspenders was a blue-and-white-striped T-shirt. The legs of her pants ended in cuffs, and on her feet were running shoes tied with purple laces.\n\n\"Hi!\" she said cheerfully. \"I'm Betsy.

Karen is six and Andrew is four, and Karen was the one doing the yelling. Andrew is sort of quiet and shy. In fact, he\u2019s very quiet and shy. He\u2019s the opposite of Karen. It\u2019s hard to believe they\u2019re brother and sister.\n\n\u201cHi, you guys!\u201d I called. I was on the upstairs landing, looking down.

One of the most important things to know about me is that I am the president, founder, and creator of a business called the Baby\u2011sitters Club.\n\nDavid Michael is my brother. He\u2019s seven. I have two other brothers. They\u2019re in high school. Sam is fifteen and Charlie is seventeen. Up until not long ago my three brothers and I lived with our mother in a small house across town here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. (Our parents are divorced.) Then my mom met this guy, Watson Brewer, a divorced millionaire. Practically before we knew it, she had married him and he had moved us into his house \u2014 which is a mansion.\n\nKaren and Andrew are Watson\u2019s children. They live with us every other weekend and for two weeks during the summer. The rest of the time they live with their mother and stepfather.\n\nTo be honest, I didn\u2019t like Watson much at first. Oh, all right. I hated him. I didn\u2019t want anything to do with him, even though he likes baseball as much as I do. I even refused to meet his kids. You know what brought us together? The Baby\u2011sitters Club. Once, in an emergency, I got a job sitting for Karen and Andrew. By the time the job was over, I thought they were the greatest kids in the world. Now I am so, so glad they\u2019re my steps.",

He likes to get it out of the way on Fridays so he can turn into a couch potato for the rest of the weekend. Charlie was out, but I was waiting for him to come home. Three times a week he drives me to and from meetings of the Baby\u2011sitters Club, which are held from five\u2011thirty until six o\u2019clock in my old neighborhood on the other side of Stoneybrook.\n\nI decided I better go check on the little kids. I never know what Karen might be up to. She\u2019s not naughty, but she\u2019s fearless and has a wild imagination. (Watson calls it \u201cfertile,\u201d I guess meaning that any idea could grow there.)\n\nTrying to keep track of all the people (not to mention animals) in my house is not easy, especially when Karen and Andrew are over. Can you believe that my mom has been talking about wanting another kid? I can\u2019t. I love children, but there\u2019s plenty of confusion at our house as it is. Besides, my mother is at least thirty\u2011seven.\n\nI found Karen, Andrew, and David Michael in the backyard. They were trying to play three\u2011man softball.\n\n\u201cThis is so dumb!\u201d David Michael was saying. (He was only saying that because he had just missed the ball.)\n\n\u201cDavid\u202fMichael,\u201d I said, \u201cwatch the ball when it\u2019s being pitched. Don\u2019t look at your bat. I know you want to connect the two of them, but believe me, you won\u2019t hit the ball if you don\u2019t look at it.\u201d\n\nKaren pitched the ball again and David\u202fMichael watched it like a hawk. He swung. Crack! The ball sailed across the yard.\n\n\u201cAll right! Home run!\u201d I yelled.\n\nI just love sports.\n\n\u201cBoy, thanks Kristy!\u201d exclaimed my brother.",

Behave yourselves, okay? Sam\u2019s home and Mom and Watson will be here soon. We\u2019ll talk about softball later.\u201d\n\nI ran to our front drive and jumped into the car, next to Charlie.\n\n\u201cReady to go visit your little friends?\u201d he teased me.\n\nI scowled. They are not little friends, and Charlie knows it. They are Claudia Kishi, Mary Anne Spier, Dawn Schafer, Mallory Pike, and Jessi Ramsey, and they are all different and special. And none of them is little. Claudia, Mary Anne, and Dawn are thirteen, like me. Jessi and Mal are eleven and in the sixth grade.\n\nI used to live next door to Mary Anne (she\u2019s my best friend) and across the street from Claudia. Us thirteen\u2011year\u2011olds are eighth\u2011graders in Stoneybrook Middle School. (Most of the kids in my new neighborhood go to private school, but Mom let my brothers and me stay in my regular public schools.)\n\nMary Anne Spier is the most sensitive person I know. Sometimes she\u2019s too sensitive. She\u2019ll cry over the slightest thing. And she\u2019s shy and quiet, like Andrew. But once she\u2019s your friend, you\u2019ve got a friend for life. She is very loyal. Maybe that\u2019s part of the reason Mary Anne was the first one of us to have a steady boyfriend. His name is Logan Bruno. Mary Anne lives with her dad and her kitten, Tigger. Her mom died a long time ago, so long ago that Mary Anne doesn\u2019t even remember her.\n\nEven though I have a big mouth and I\u2019m far from shy, Mary Anne and I are alike in some ways. For one thing, we look alike. We both have brown eyes and brown hair and are short. I\u2019m the shortest kid in our grade, believe it or not, but Mary Anne has grown slightly. For another thing, we don\u2019t care much about c",

          "text": "\"Kindergarten baby, stick your head in gravy! Wash it off with applesauce and show it to the Navy!\" sang Nicky.\n\n\"Mommy, make him stop!\" cried Claire.\n\n\"Nicholas Pike,\" said my mother, \"this is supposed to be fun. We are going to Washington Mall, which you have been begging to do for weeks, and where, I might add, each of you kids is going to get a new pair of shoes. You do want new shoes, don\u2019t you?\"\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Nicky contritely.\n\n\"Then apologize to your sister. She doesn\u2019t like being called a kindergarten baby. You didn\u2019t like it either when you were her age.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Claire,\" said Nicky.\n\nMom didn\u2019t see it, because we were so jam\u2011packed into our car, but Claire\u2019s response was to stick her tongue out at Nicky. So he silently mouthed \"kindergarten baby\" to her and she turned bright red. If I hadn\u2019t grabbed her then, who knows what would have happened?\n\nThere are eight kids in my family. Nicky and Claire are just two of them, but they were having a big enough fight for all of us.\n\nI am Mallory. I\u2019m eleven and the oldest. Claire is five and the youngest. Between Claire and me are Margo, who\u2019s seven, Nicky, who\u2019s eight, Vanessa, who\u2019s nine, and the triplets, who are ten. The triplets are Adam, Byron, and Jordan, and they\u2019re identical. You would hardly know this, though, since they always wear different clothes and have such different personalities.\n\nAfter I grabbed Claire, she calmed down. It was a good thing I was sitting between her and Nicky. I had put myself there on purpose. When it comes to kids \u2014 my brothers and sisters, or any others \u2014 I\u2019m pretty smart. For instance, I had figured out the seating arrangement for our outing to the mall. (It takes awhile to drive there.) I had put Margo in the front seat with Mom and Dad, since she gets carsick sometimes and riding in the front is less bumpy. I had put the triplets in the way back, where they could be jerks without bothering anybody, especially Nicky, whom they are apt to tease mercilessly. And in the backseat, I had put Claire, me, Nicky, and Vanessa, in that order. Sitting between Claire and Nicky, I could break up fights. And with Vanessa by the window, she could daydream or make up poems, lost in her own world, which is how she\u2019s happiest.\n\n\"There\u2019s the mall!\" cried Margo, pointing. She had survived the trip without once saying she was going to barf.\n\n\"All right!\" cried Nicky. \"New shoes. I want sneakers, and they have to be Reeboks. Or Avias. Either one.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are so cool, Nick,\" said Adam sarcastically from the back.\n\n\"Shut up!\"\n\n\"You shut up!\"\n\n\"Mom, Nicky and Adam said \u2018shut up,\u2019\" announced Claire.\n\n\"I heard,\" said Mom dryly. (Poor Mom. Since Dad was driving, she got stuck handling the squabbling and complaining.) \"And all I have to say is this: How badly does any of you want shoes?\"\n\nUs kids \u2018shut up\u2019 right away. We didn\u2019t think Mom would really not buy shoes for us \u2026 but we couldn\u2019t be sure. Long car rides with eight children could drive anyone crazy. (I should point out, by the way, that our mother is not an ogre. She\u2019s just human. And half an hour of kindergarten baby and tattling was wearing on her nerves.)",

We hiked over to a boutique, walked through it, and were in \u2026 the mall.\n\nI swear, the mall is another world. You are surrounded by stores and shops, and even better things: food stands, exhibits, a flower mart, and my personal favorite, the ear\u2011piercing boutique. I hardly know where to look.\n\nAs badly as we wanted new shoes, my brothers and sisters and I also wanted to be turned loose to go exploring.\n\nBut, \u201cShoes first,\u201d said Dad.\n\nSo we went to Antoinette\u2019s Shoe Tree (what on earth is a shoe tree?) and each got what we needed \u2014 not, I might emphasize, what we wanted. For example, what I wanted were these extremely cool pink shoes with green trim. What I got were loafers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re much more practical,\u201d said Mom. \u201cThey go with almost everything you own. And they\u2019ll last at least a year.\u201d\n\nWhen you are a parent of eight children, you have to think of these things. But when you are an eleven\u2011year\u2011old who has to show up in school every day, you just want those cool pink shoes.\n\nAs soon as we\u2019d gotten our shoes, Mom and Dad let us kids split up so we could explore the mall for an hour. We had brought along spending money and were eager to, well, spend it. So the triplets went off by themselves, Nicky went off with Dad, Vanessa went off with Mom, and Claire and Margo begged to come with me.",

It was my sister, Becca, pretending she was a cat.\n\nI patted the top of her head but said, \"Becca, I really have to do my homework.\"\n\n\"Then how come you\u2019re lying on your bed?\" asked Becca, getting to her feet.\n\n\"Because this is a comfortable way to work.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re supposed to sit at your desk.\"\n\nThis is true. My parents believe that homework magically gets done better if you\u2019re sitting up than if you\u2019re lying down.\n\nI sighed. Then I changed the subject, which usually distracts Becca. \"Why are you a cat tonight?\" I asked her.\n\nShe shrugged. \"I\u2019m trying all the animals. It\u2019s fun to pretend.\"\n\nThe night before, Becca had been a dog, the night before that, a horse.\n\n\"Well, kitty, let me finish my work,\" I said.\n\n\"Meow,\" replied Becca, who dropped to her hands and knees and crawled into the hallway.\n\nBecca is eight and has a big imagination. If she weren\u2019t so shy, she\u2019d probably make a really terrific actress, but she has awful stage fright.\n\nI do not have stage fright, which is lucky since I\u2019m a ballet dancer and have to perform in front of audiences all the time.",

I am Jessi Ramsey, and I\u2019m eleven and in sixth grade. \"Jessi\" is short for \"Jessica.\" (And \"Becca\" is short for \"Rebecca,\" as if you couldn\u2019t have guessed.) Becca and I live with our parents and our baby brother, Squirt. Squirt\u2019s real name is John Philip Ramsey, Jr. When he was born, he was so tiny that the nurses in the hospital started calling him Squirt. Now his nickname seems sort of funny. Well, it always has been funny, but it seems especially funny since Squirt, who has just learned to walk, is now the size of most other babies his age.\n\nAnyway, as I said before, I\u2019m a ballet dancer. I\u2019ve been taking dance classes for years. My ballet school is in Stamford, which isn\u2019t too far from Stoneybrook, Connecticut, where my family and I live. We haven\u2019t lived here long, though. We moved to Connecticut from New Jersey just a few months ago when my dad was offered a job he couldn\u2019t turn down.\n\nOh, something else about my family \u2014 we\u2019re black. Actually, that\u2019s much more important than I\u2019m making it sound. You know what? It wasn\u2019t so important when we were living in Oakley, New Jersey. Our old neighborhood was mixed black and white, and so was my ballet school and my regular school. But believe it or not, we are one of the few black families in all of Stoneybrook. In fact, I\u2019m the only black student in my whole grade. When we first moved here, some people weren\u2019t very nice to us. Some were even mean. But things have settled down and are getting better. Becca and I are making friends. Actually, I have a lot more friends than Becca does. There are two reasons for this: one, I\u2019m not shy; two, I belong to the Baby\u2011sitters Club. (More about that later.)\n\nMy mother is wonderful and so is my father. We\u2019re a very close family. Mama, Daddy, Becca, Squirt, and me. No pets. We\u2019ve never had a pet, although Becca apparently wishes we had one. (Sometimes I do, too, for that matter.)",

The club is really a business, a sitting business. It was started by Kristy Thomas, who\u2019s the president. There are six of us in the club. We sit for kids in our neighborhoods, and we get lots of jobs and have lots of fun.\n\nMy best friend in Stoneybrook is Mallory Pike. Mal and I have a lot of classes together at Stoneybrook Middle School. And Mal is the one who got me into the Baby\u2011Sitters Club. The girls needed another member and ended up taking both of us. We were just getting to be friends then \u2014 and now that we\u2019ve been in the club together for awhile, we\u2019re best friends. (I have another best friend in Oakley \u2014 my cousin Keisha.)\n\nAnyway, the people in the club are Mallory, Kristy, me, plus Claudia Kishi, Mary Anne Spier, and Dawn Schafer. Two people who are sort of part of the club but who don\u2019t come to our meetings are our associate members, Logan Bruno and Shannon Kilbourne. (I\u2019ll tell you more about them later.) It\u2019s funny that us six club members work so well together, because boy, are we different. We have different personalities, different tastes, different looks, and different kinds of families.\n\nKristy Thomas, our president, is \u2026well, talk about not shy. Kristy is direct and outgoing. Sometimes she can be loud and bossy. But basically she\u2019s really nice. And she\u2019s always full of ideas. Kristy is thirteen and in eighth grade. (So are all the club members, except Mal and me.) She has this long brown hair and is pretty, but doesn\u2019t pay much attention to her looks. I mean, she never bothers with makeup, and she always wears jeans, a turtleneck, a sweater, and sneakers. Kristy\u2019s family is sort of interesting. Her parents are divorced, and for the longest time, Kristy lived with just her mom, her two older brothers, Sam and Charlie (they\u2019re in high school), and her little brother, David Michael, who\u2019s seven now. But when her mom met this millionaire, Watson Brewer, and got remarried, things sure changed for Kristy. For one thing, Watson moved Kristy\u2019s family into his mansion, which is on the other side of Stoneybrook. Kristy used to live next door to Mary Anne Spier and across the street from Claudia Kishi. Now she\u2019s in a new neighborhood. For another thing, Kristy acquired a little stepsister and stepbrother \u2014 Watson\u2019s children from his first marriage. Karen is six and Andrew is four. Although it took Kristy some time to adjust to her new life, she sure loves Karen and Andrew. They\u2019re among her favorite baby\u2011sitting charges. Kristy\u2019s family has two pets \u2014 an adorable puppy named Shannon and a fat old cat named Boo\u2011Boo.\n\nThe vice\u2011president of the Baby\u2011Sitters Club is Claudia Kishi, and she is totally cool.

So how come I ended up feeling so confused? Believe me, there\u2019s a lot to tell. And I might as well start at the beginning.\n\nFirst off, you\u2019re probably wondering who Sunshine is. Well, that\u2019s me. Of course nobody around here calls me Sunshine. Here in Connecticut they call me by my regular name, Dawn Schafer. But not my dad. He started calling me Sunshine when I was little and, unfortunately, it stuck. Maybe he gave me the name because of my long blonde hair. My hair is so light it\u2019s almost the color of cornsilk, and it reaches all the way past my waist. Or maybe Dad gave me the name because I love the sun so much. I really do. I love warm weather and the beach.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just a California girl at heart. After all, that\u2019s where I came from. And that Sunday, I was getting to go back for a visit!",

          "text": "I got the postcard from Dad when I came home from school that Thursday afternoon. I still had so much to do, so much to get ready. I dragged my suitcase out of the closet, threw it on the bed, and started to lay out my clothes. I decided to bring my white cotton skirt \u2014 I could wear that with anything. And, of course, my bathing suit (a bikini) and my jeans and sneakers. I wasn\u2019t sure about my yellow cotton overalls. And would I really need three sundresses?\n\nMaybe you\u2019re wondering why my dad lives in California and I live in Connecticut. Well, sometimes I wonder, too. Believe me, it\u2019s not the way I would\u2019ve arranged it. But even so, things are working out okay. You see, about a year and a half ago, Mom and Dad got divorced. Dad stayed in our house in California and Mom moved me and my brother, Jeff, here to Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I think Mom wanted to come here because my grandparents live here and it\u2019s the town where she grew up. To tell the truth, at first I wasn\u2019t the happiest, but then I adjusted. I found myself a best friend, Mary Anne Spier, and I got invited to join the Baby-sitters Club, which is just about the most fun club in the whole wide world.\n\nMy brother, Jeff, though, didn\u2019t adjust so easily. In fact, he didn\u2019t adjust at all. He started getting kind of nasty with me and Mom, and he even started to get in fights at school. It was pretty bad. His teacher kept calling up Mom and I don\u2019t think Mom knew what to do. Finally we decided to let Jeff go back to California for awhile. He really just wanted to be back with his friends and live with Dad. I don\u2019t think Mom was thrilled with the idea, but she figured she had to let Jeff try it for six months.\n\nMe, I didn\u2019t like the idea at all. It was bad enough that Mom and Dad had to get divorced. Already our family was split. But when Jeff left Mom and me, too, it felt like Jeff was up and deserting us. And then another part of me thought, hey, why couldn\u2019t I be the one to get to move back to California?\n\nNow I\u2019m kind of used to the idea. In my head I understand all the reasons why things are the way they are. But sometimes it does seem strange the way the family has divided up. Boys against the girls. Or West Coast against the East Coast. I love Mom, and she and I get to stay together, but of course I love Dad and Jeff, and I miss them sometimes. And I know they miss us, too.\n\nBut Mom is the greatest. She and I have gotten a lot closer through all of this and we\u2019ve made a whole new life for ourselves. We live in an old, old farmhouse that was built in 1795. No kidding. The rooms are really small and the doorways are so short that tall people have to stoop to get through them. Mom says people used to be shorter in the 1700s.\n\nThe best thing about our house, though, is that it has a secret trapdoor in our barn that leads into a long, dark tunnel. You need a flashlight to walk through. The tunnel leads up into our house and comes out \u2026 right at the wall to my bedroom! The wall has a special latch that springs open to the touch. Talk about exciting. You should\u2019ve seen the faces on my friends in the Baby-sitters Club when I showed them.",

What it is is just what it says, a club for baby\u2011sitters. It was Kristy Thomas\u2019s great idea. She\u2019s our president. She figured that it would be great if there was a club that all the parents in the neighborhood could use whenever they needed a sitter. That way, they\u2019d be pretty sure of getting someone for the job and they\u2019d only have to make one call. Great for them, and great for us, too, since we\u2019re all super sitters and we love the work. Leave it to Kristy to come up with a good business idea. And leave it to Kristy to organize the whole thing.\n\nWhat we do is this: Three times a week we have meetings in the afternoon. We meet at Claudia\u2019s house because she has a phone in her room \u2026 with her very own number! Claudia is Claudia Kishi and she\u2019s our vice\u2011president. Claudia is about as different from Kristy as you can get. Kristy is kind of small for her age and is a real tomboy. She always wears the same thing \u2014 jeans, a turtle neck, and sneakers. But not Claudia. You can always count on Claudia to be wearing some really unusual outfit, like a white jumpsuit with a wide purple belt and purple high\u2011top sneakers. Claudia\u2019s Japanese\u2011American and she\u2019s got beautiful, long, shiny black hair that she fixes differently practically every day. She loves art, too, so she has a really interesting sense of style.\n\nAfter those two, there\u2019s Mary Anne Spier, our club secretary, and, as I said, she\u2019s my best friend in Stoneybrook. Mary Anne lives alone with her father because her mother died when she was a baby. Her father\u2019s been kind of strict with her and a lot of people think Mary Anne\u2019s quiet. It\u2019s true, she can be shy sometimes. But wouldn\u2019t you know it, she was the first one of us to get a boyfriend!",

          "text": "I\u2019ve been thinking about families lately, wondering what makes one. Is a family really a mother, a father, and a kid or two? I hope not, because if that\u2019s a family, then I haven\u2019t got one. And neither do a lot of other people I know. For instance, Nannie, Mom\u2019s mother, lives all by herself. But I still think of her as a family \u2014 a one-person family. And I think of my own family as a real family \u2026 I guess.\n\nWhat I mean is, well, my family didn\u2019t start out the way it is now. It started out as two families that split up and came together as \u2026 Uh\u2011oh. I know that\u2019s confusing. I\u2019m a little ahead of myself. I better back up and begin at the beginning.\n\nThis is the beginning: Hi! I\u2019m Kristy Thomas. I\u2019m thirteen years old. I\u2019m in eighth grade. I\u2019m the president of the Baby\u2011sitters Club (more about that later). I like sports, and I guess you could say I\u2019m a tomboy. (Well, wouldn\u2019t you be one if you had a whole bunch of brothers?) I\u2019m not the neatest person in the world. I don\u2019t care much about boys or clothes. I\u2019m famous for coming up with big ideas.\n\nOkay, enough about me. Let me tell you about \u2014",

          "text": "Knock, knock.\n\nDarn, I thought. Who could that be? It was a Friday evening and I didn\u2019t have any plans or even a baby\u2011sitting job. I was in my bedroom, just messing around, enjoying my free time.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d I called.\n\n\u201cOswald!\u201d my little sister replied.\n\nOswald? Oh\u2026. \u201cOswald who?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cHelp! Help! Oswald my gum!\u201d\n\nI was laughing as I opened the door and found a very giggly Karen in the hallway.\n\n\u201cPretty funny,\u201d I said, as Karen ran into my room and threw herself on my bed. \u201cWhere\u2019d you hear that one?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn school. Nancy told it to me. What are you doing with the door closed?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust fooling around.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is our first night here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Karen. I didn\u2019t mean to shut you out. It\u2019s just that I had a rotten week at school and today was especially rotten, so I wanted to be by myself for awhile.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering why Karen said, \u201cBut this is our first night here.\u201d I think now would be a good time to explain my family to you. See, Karen isn\u2019t exactly my sister. She\u2019s my stepsister. Her little brother Andrew is my stepbrother, and her father is my stepfather. Karen and Andrew only live with us part\u2011time. I like when they come over because then my family consists of Mom, Watson (he\u2019s my stepfather), Sam, Charlie, and David Michael (they\u2019re my brothers), and Karen and Andrew. Oh, and Shannon and Boo\u2011Boo. They\u2019re our dog and cat, and they\u2019re part of the family, too.\n\nHow did I get this weird family? Well, you can probably imagine. My mom and dad were divorced. They got divorced right after David Michael was born. Then, a couple of years ago, Mom met Watson and started going out with him. Watson was divorced, too. And after awhile, Mom and Watson got married, and then Mom and my brothers and I moved into Watson\u2019s house. That\u2019s how I got my big family. The only unusual thing is that Watson is a millionaire. Honest. That\u2019s why we moved into his house. It\u2019s a lot bigger than our old one. It\u2019s huge. In fact, it\u2019s basically a mansion. Living in a mansion here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, is fun, but sometimes I miss my old house. It\u2019s on the other side of town, where all my friends are.\n\nSo now I\u2019m part of a six\u2011kid family. My brother Charlie is the oldest kid. He\u2019s seventeen, a senior in high school, and thinks he\u2019s a big shot. Sam is fifteen. He\u2019s a sophomore in high school. Then there\u2019s me, then David Michael, who\u2019s seven, and then Karen and Andrew, who are six and four. Usually, Karen and Andrew only live with us every other weekend and for two weeks during the summer. The rest of the time they live with their mother, who\u2019s not too far away \u2014 in a different neighborhood in Stoneybrook. But the night Karen bounced into my room with her knock\u2011knock joke was the beginning of a much longer stay. Karen and Andrew were going to be with us for several weeks while their mother and stepfather went on a business trip.\n\n\u201cKnock, knock,\u201d said Karen again.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cHey, Karen! Come here!\u201d It was David Michael, yelling down the hall.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Karen yelled back.\n\n\u201cCome look at this bug!\u201d (David Michael just loves bugs.)\n\nKaren was off my bed and out of my room in a flash.\n\nI smiled. I really like my family, especially when Karen and Andrew are here. The bigger, the better. Sometimes I think of my friends as family, too. Is that weird? I don\u2019t know. But my friends do feel like family. I guess I\u2019m mostly talking about my friends in the Baby\u2011sitters Club. That\u2019s a club I started myself. Actually, it\u2019s more of a business. My friends and I sit for families in Stoneybrook and we earn a lot of money.",

That\u2019s the way it is with families.\n\nFor instance, I\u2019m pretty outgoing (some people say I have a big mouth), and as I mentioned before, I like sports and couldn\u2019t care less about clothes or boys. My best friend is Mary Anne Spier (she\u2019s our club secretary) and we are different. Mary Anne is quiet and shy, hates sports, is becoming interested in clothes, has a boyfriend, and comes from a very small family. She lives with just her dad and her kitten, Tigger. Her mom died a long time ago. Mary Anne and I have always been different and have always been best friends. We lived next door to each other until Mom married Watson, so we practically grew up together. One thing that\u2019s the same about us is our looks. We both have brown hair and brown eyes and are short for our age.\n\nThe vice\u2011president of the Baby\u2011sitters Club is Claudia Kishi. Claud lives across the street from Mary Anne. There is nothing, and I mean nothing, typical or average or ordinary about Claudia. To begin with, she\u2019s Japanese\u2011American. Her hair is silky and long and jet\u2011black.

          "text": "\"I just don\u2019t understand,\" Dawn Schafer said to me as we slowed down for a stop sign. \u201cHow can someone as small as Tigger knock his toys behind the refrigerator, so that you can\u2019t even get to them?\u201d\n\nI shrugged. Then I checked the street. The coast was clear, so we pedaled across the intersection. \u201cHe just does, that\u2019s all,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd thank you for calling Tigger a someone instead of a something.\u201d\n\nDawn smiled. \u201cI still don\u2019t get it, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I know,\u201d I said, \u201cis that his toys roll into that space between the wall and the side of the fridge, where I ought to be able to get them out. You know where I mean?\u201d (Dawn nodded.) \u201cWell, they roll in there and I never see them again.\u201d\n\n\u201cSort of a black hole for cat toys,\u201d said Dawn.\n\nI giggled. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing underneath the fridge. I looked there with a flashlight. That leaves in back of the fridge. And I can\u2019t get there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is why we\u2019re riding our bikes all the way downtown just to buy cat toys,\u201d said Dawn.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d I replied.\n\nIn case you can\u2019t tell, Dawn Schafer is my friend. (I\u2019m Mary Anne Spier.) Dawn is one of my best friends, in fact. And Tigger is my kitten. My one and only. He\u2019s a gray tiger cat with very pretty stripes. If I do say so, he\u2019s smart. Smart and pretty. And he can catch flies, which is difficult. I mean, when you only have paws.\n\nDawn and I were on our way to downtown Stoneybrook, Connecticut, to stock up on cat toys for Tigger, since he keeps losing them behind the fridge. His favorites are those plastic balls with a little bell inside. They come three in a pack, and he loses about three a week, so cat toys can be expensive to me. Thank goodness I earn lots of money baby-sitting.\n\nDawn and I stopped at a traffic light. We had reached Stoneybrook\u2019s main street (which is about as small as Stoneybrook is), and were only three blocks from the pet store.\n\n\u201cHey, what did your dad say about the date last night?\u201d asked Dawn.\n\nWe laughed. Dawn\u2019s mom and my dad go out sometimes. We really wish they would get married, but we can\u2019t help laughing. It\u2019s just so weird to see your own parents dating. Especially dating each other. They go out with other people, too, but when Dawn\u2019s mom has a date with my dad, she puts on all this makeup and checks her clothes twenty times and then asks Dawn to check her clothes again. And my dad puts on after-shave that smells like the dentist\u2019s office and gets nervous and can barely speak to me. Then they go somewhere together. What a pair.\n\nBy the way, the reason they can date is Dawn\u2019s parents are divorced and my mom died ages ago. I really don\u2019t even remember her.\n\n\u201cI think my dad had fun when they went out,\u201d I told Dawn. \u201cWhat about your mom?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame,\u201d she replied. Then she announced, \u201cPet store,\u201d and stopped her bike. \u201cHey, I just thought of something.\u201d Dawn was grinning.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she replied, \u201cthere\u2019s not much space behind your refrigerator, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d We were chaining our bikes to a lamppost.\n\n\u201cProbably just enough space for the width of one toy, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Tigger\u2019s toys are probably behind the fridge in a line. And when the line reaches the wall, there won\u2019t be room for any more toys, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d I replied as we entered the store.",

          "text": "I headed for the cat toy department and picked up two packages of Tigger\u2019s toys. In one package, the balls were half pink and half green. In the other, they were half orange and half yellow. I like to give Tigger a little variety in his toys. Then I began looking over the cat treats. Maybe I should buy some fancy food for Tigger.\n\nI was counting my money when Dawn tapped me on the arm. \u201cWe better go,\u201d she said. \u201cClub meeting in forty\u2011five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. Just let me buy these.\u201d I held up the toys.\n\nI stood in line at the counter, thinking about the Baby\u2011sitters Club. My closest friends are all in the club: Kristy Thomas (she\u2019s my other best friend), Claudia Kishi, Jessi Ramsey, Mallory Pike, Dawn, and Logan Bruno (an associate member, who doesn\u2019t usually attend club meetings. I\u2019ll explain that later). Logan is basically my boyfriend, and he is incredible in every way. He\u2019s incredible-looking and incredibly nice and incredibly thoughtful and, well, incredibly incredible.\n\n(There is also one person who\u2019s in the club who is not a close friend, and one person who is a close friend who\u2019s not really in the club anymore. I\u2019ll tell you about them later.)\n\nThe Baby\u2011sitters Club is more a business than a club. My friends and I sit for families in our neighborhoods. We get a lot of jobs and earn a lot of money. And I spend a lot of my money right here in the pet store. The club was started by Kristy Thomas, our president. (I\u2019m the secretary, by the way.) In some ways, Kristy is like me, but in more ways, she\u2019s my exact opposite. I think that\u2019s why she was my very first best friend. That and the fact that we lived next door to each other from the time we were born. Here are the things that are the same about us: We\u2019re small for our age and have brown hair and brown eyes. Here are the ways in which we\u2019re different: I\u2019m shy and sort of held in; Kristy is outgoing and can be a loudmouth. I\u2019m beginning to take an interest in what I wear; Kristy couldn\u2019t care less. She always wears jeans, a turtleneck, a sweater, and running shoes. (Well, not in the summer, of course, but you know what I mean.)\n\nKristy has more ideas than anyone I know. She\u2019s always thinking of things to do, or finding ways to solve problems. You can almost see her brain at work. Lately, Kristy\u2019s life hasn\u2019t been too easy, though. It hasn\u2019t been bad, just not easy. For the longest time, she lived with her mom, her three brothers, and her collie, Louie, right next door to me. (Her parents had gotten a divorce.) Then her mom met this millionaire, Watson Brewer, and the next thing I knew, they\u2019d decided to get married. After the wedding, K",

Special tea is when my grandmother prepares Japanese tea and serves it in cups with no handles that she brought with her when she moved from Japan to America.

Mimi\u2019s were wrinkled and brown like walnuts, and they shook. Mimi is my mother\u2019s mother and she\u2019s getting pretty old.\n\nAs you have probably guessed, Mimi is Japanese. She came to the United States a long time ago, when she was thirty\u2011two. Her husband was Japanese, too, so of course my mom is Japanese. And so is my dad. Janine and I consider ourselves not just Japanese, but Japanese\u2011American, meaning that we\u2019re full\u2011blooded Asian but we\u2019ve lived all our lives in the U.S. Actually, we\u2019ve lived all our lives here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. And Mimi has lived all of my life in Stoneybrook, because her husband died after Mom and Dad got married, so she moved in with them. Both of my parents were working. They were doing different things then, but now Dad is a partner in an investment firm in Stamford, Connecticut, which is nearby, and Mom is the head librarian at our public library. Anyway, when my grandfather died, Janine the genius had just been born, so Mimi\u2019s moving in seemed like the perfect arrangement. Three years later, I was born, and there was Mimi to help raise me. Mimi is my friend and the person who understands me the best in the world, even better than my friends.",

She\u2019s smart enough to be a high school junior who takes courses at a college in Stoneybrook. That\u2019s right, a college. When I say she\u2019s a genius, I mean it. Her I.Q. is, like, nine million or something. We used to sort of hate each other, but as we grow up, we get along much better. For one thing, we\u2019ve been worried about Mimi a lot lately, and that\u2019s brought us closer together. Worry and fear can do that.\n\nI looked around my messy room.

A flying saucer had crashed through our roof, and Martians were streaming down the staircase to capture us and take us off to Spacecreatureland.\n\nSo what was it? Fortunately, the answer was: None of the Above. The truth was, Becca was only calling us because of a TV show. The show had just come on and she wanted us to watch it with her.\n\nMama, Daddy, Squirt, and I were in the kitchen, cleaning up after dinner. Well, Squirt wasn\u2019t exactly cleaning up.

          "text": "Maybe I should introduce myself and my family before I start the story. My full name is Jessica Davis Ramsey, but everybody calls me Jessi. I\u2019m eleven years old and in sixth grade. I\u2019m black, and just to give you an idea of how few black families live here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, I\u2019ll tell you that I\u2019m the only black kid in my entire grade at Stoneybrook Middle School. I keep my hair long because I take ballet class two times a week and ballerinas are supposed to be able to pull their hair back. Probably my best feature is my legs. They\u2019re long, long, long, which is great for dancing. My grandma always says they\u2019re graceful, too. And Mama says I move like a cat. I take that as a compliment.\n\nYou can tell I have a nice family. I live with my parents, eight\u2011year\u2011old sister Becca (that\u2019s short for Rebecca) and my baby brother Squirt. No, his real name\u2019s not Squirt, it\u2019s John Philip Ramsey, Jr. But when he was born, he was the tiniest baby in the hospital, so the nurses gave him a special nickname.\n\nAs I said, my family and I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, but we used to live in Oakley, New Jersey, and that was great because my grandparents lived on the same street as we did and so did a lot of my aunts and uncles and cousins. One of my cousins, Keisha, was my very best friend. She and I have the exact same birthday, and Keisha always seemed to know what I was feeling about things.\n\nI\u2019d lived in Oakley since I was a baby, but then Daddy\u2019s company transferred him to Stamford, Connecticut, so we found this house in Stoneybrook, nearby. I\u2019ll tell you honestly, sometimes I still miss Oakley. It was a little easier to be myself there. And I especially miss Keisha. I mean, how many best friends have known each other since they were one day old?\n\nWell, Stoneybrook doesn\u2019t have Keisha. And it doesn\u2019t have my wonderful grandparents or my aunts and uncles. But it does offer a lot of other things. Since we moved here, I enrolled in a very good ballet school in Stamford. To get in, I had to audition. And then Daddy built me my very own ballet barre and practice area in our basement. I also found myself another best friend. Her name is Mallory Pike. And because of Mallory, I now belong to one of the greatest clubs in the world \u2014 the Baby\u2011sitters Club. Maybe that\u2019s been the best thing about moving to Stoneybrook.\n\nThe club was the great idea of Kristy Thomas. She\u2019s an eighth\u2011grader who goes to my school. Last year, when she was in seventh grade, she got together with a bunch of friends who love to baby\u2011sit and they formed a club. They sent out fliers to all the families in the neighborhood \u2014 very professional \u2014 and pretty soon they had a booming business. Leave it to Kristy. She\u2019s a take\u2011charge type of person. The club meets three afternoons a week \u2014 Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 5:30 until 6:00 \u2014 and families who need a baby\u2011sitter know to call us up during club hours. The great thing is that one of us is bound to be free. So our clients are sure of getting a sitter and, meanwhile, we get plenty of jobs. Everybody\u2019s happy!\n\nAll the club members are eighth\u2011graders except for Mallory and me. Mallory got in because all the Baby\u2011sitters knew her. See, the girls had sat a lot for Mallory\u2019s family, the Pikes. Oh, I guess I forgot to tell you. Mallory is from a big family, and I\u2019m talking big. Believe it or not, there are eight kids in the Pike family. Mallory\u2019s the oldest. Mrs. Pike used to hire sitters from the club and Mallory would always help them out. Of course, being the oldest of eight, Mallory was always great with the kids. So when there was an opening in the club, Kristy decided to let her in. Lucky me, she decided to let me in at the same time!",

Henry and Grace and I live really near the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, and Henry likes to visit the dinosaur exhibits.\n\nHenry shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t really matter. I\u2019ll just pretend a steg could beat a bronto.\u201d (Henry is on familiar terms with dinosaurs. Oh, excuse me. With dinos.)",

          "text": "Maybe I better stop here and introduce Henry and Grace and myself. I am Stacey McGill and I\u2019m thirteen years old. Henry and Grace and I live on the Upper West Side of New York City. In fact, we live in the same building. I live on the 12th floor and the Walkers live on the 18th floor. Mr. and Mrs. Walker are artists, and Henry and Grace, who are five and three, are my two favorite baby\u2011sitting charges.\n\nBelieve me, I do a lot of baby\u2011sitting. Sometimes I\u2019m amazed by all the things that have happened to me because of baby\u2011sitting. For instance, I live in a large (okay, a huge) apartment building with plenty of little kids, but not many kids my age \u2014 and hardly anyone else who\u2019s interested in sitting. So I get a lot of jobs, have a lot of fun (especially with Henry and Grace), and earn a lot of money.\n\nThat\u2019s just the beginning, though. I\u2019ve lived in New York City all my life except for one year. That year, my parents and I (I\u2019m an only child) lived in a small town in Connecticut called Stoneybrook. My dad had been transferred there by the company he works for. We thought the move was going to be permanent, so I was desperate to make friends in Stoneybrook \u2014 and fast. Guess how baby\u2011sitting helped me. I heard about this group of girls who were starting something called the Baby\u2011sitters Club. They wanted to run a business sitting for families in the neighborhood \u2014 and they were looking for another member! So I joined. Instant friends. I\u2019m still really close to most of the girls in the club, especially Claudia Kishi. She\u2019s my Connecticut best friend. (My New York best friend is Laine Cummings.) Then there\u2019re Dawn Schafer, Mary Anne Spier, and Kristy Thomas. They\u2019re good friends, too. Mallory Pike is a little young to be a close friend, and I don\u2019t know Jessi Ramsey too well yet (Mal and Jessi replaced me when Dad was transferred again, and we moved back to New York), but I still consider them friends.\n\nAnyway, yes, that\u2019s right. After a year in Connecticut, Dad\u2019s stupid company transferred him right back to where he\u2019d been. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I New York, just like the bumper stickers and the T\u2011shirts say. I really do it. I the stores, especially Bloomingdale\u2019s, the theaters, the museums, the parks, the excitement. I even tourists, because they add to the excitement. But I didn\u2019t all the trauma and trouble of moving twice in just a little over a year.\n\nStill, we did move, and when we got back to New York I was thirteen, not twelve, and we moved into this huge building with all these kids, and I\u2019ve been sitting practically ever since. Things aren\u2019t the same without the Baby\u2011sitters Club, even though I consider myself the New York branch of the BSC. But I wouldn\u2019t trade big\u2011city life for anything.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t trade sitting for the Walkers, either. I adore Henry and Grace. There\u2019s just something wonderful about them. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re well behaved (which they are). It\u2019s not that they\u2019re creative and can always be entertained with art projects. No, I think it\u2019s that they\u2019re such caring kids. They look out for each other, they stick up for their friends, and they try very hard never to hurt anybody\u2019s feelings.",

          "text": "So of course Henry was pleasant about my being in outer space the afternoon he asked his dinosaur question, and then about my not knowing the answer.\n\n\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d I asked Grace, looking at her picture.\n\nGrace was bent over, concentrating hard. She was drawing slowly and carefully, her tongue sticking out of the corner of her mouth.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d she replied, straightening up. \u201cDo you like my picture, Stacey? It\u2019s an elephant. And the elephant is in a bathtub, but there\u2019s no water in it. He\u2019s taking a nap. See? There\u2019s his pillow.\u201d\n\nHenry giggled. \u201cGive him a blanket,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd show that he\u2019s dreaming about a bronto.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I draw a dream?\u201d wondered Grace. She pulled at her curly hair.\n\n\u201cLike this.\u201d Henry drew a \u201cdream bubble\u201d over the elephant\u2019s head. \u201cNow put a bronto in there,\u201d he instructed his little sister.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Grace. \u201cThank you, Henry.\u201d\n\nI smiled. What terrific kids. In fact, the whole Walker family is terrific. Mr. Walker is an artist and Mrs. Walker illustrates children\u2019s books. They\u2019re both pretty well known. The reason I was sitting for Grace and Henry that Wednesday afternoon was that a showing of Mr. Walker\u2019s work was going to open soon, and the Walkers had gone to the gallery to help supervise the hanging of some of his paintings. I guess another thing you should know about the Walkers is that they\u2019re black. There aren\u2019t too many black families in our building. You know what\u2019s funny, though? When I\u2019m with the Walkers I don\u2019t think of them as black, just as people. I feel the same way when I\u2019m with Jessi Ramsey, one of the new members of the BSC. I don\u2019t see her as black, just as an eleven\u2011year\u2011old baby\u2011sitter who\u2019s Mallory Pike\u2019s best friend. I have never understood the big deal about black or",

          "text": "I closed my journal with a snap. I have been keeping a journal for some time now. The difference between a journal and a diary, as far as I can tell, is that a diary is a recording of daily events and you\u2019re supposed to write in it every day. For me, a diary entry would probably go like this (on a weekday):\n\nPretty dull, huh? But a journal entry would be much more deep and sensitive and interesting. Also, I don\u2019t write in my journal every day, just whenever I feel like it. And my journal is a plain old composition book. You know, one of the ones with a mottled black-and-white cover. It\u2019s not set up with four lines for March 2nd, four lines for March 3rd, four lines for March 4th, etc. It\u2019s blank. So I can write as much or as little whenever I want. And I only write when I feel an urgency, which is often \u2014 whenever I\u2019m angry or confused or think I haven\u2019t been treated fairly. Also when good things happen.\n\nYesterday I didn\u2019t write in my journal at all. Today, which is Sunday, I was feeling sort of pensive, so I wrote:\n\nI hid my journal under my mattress. As far as I know, Vanessa hasn\u2019t found it there. It wouldn\u2019t be like her to go looking for it, though. Vanessa is a poet, and understands the need to keep your writing private.\n\nWho\u2019s Vanessa? She\u2019s my sister. I have seven younger brothers and sisters in all. After me (I\u2019m Mallory Pike) come the triplets \u2014 Byron, Adam, and Jordan. They\u2019re ten. Then there\u2019s Vanessa, who\u2019s nine; Nicky, who\u2019s eight; Margo, who\u2019s seven; and Claire, the baby of the family. Claire is five and very silly. She calls everybody a silly-billy-goo-goo. For instance, my Claire-name is Mallory-silly-billy-goo-goo.\n\nJust as I was hiding my journal, I heard Mom call from downstairs, \u201cMal? Can you come here for a sec?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d I replied.",

I know they moved in a week ago, but I figure a casserole is always appreciated.

Well, while Mom\u2019s casserole cools, I\u2019ll tell you about the McGills and my BSC friends.\n\nFirst of all, the BSC is a club that I belong to. It\u2019s really more of a business, and the other people in it are my friends Jessi Ramsey, Stacey McGill, Kristy Thomas, Dawn Schafer, Mary Anne Spier, and Claudia Kishi. What our club does is baby\u2011sit for families here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. It is super\u2011fun, and I feel very cool to be allowed in it.\n\nYou see, the club was started by Kristy, Claudia, Stacey, and Mary Anne, who are all thirteen years old now and in eighth grade. Jessi and I are the only eleven\u2011year\u2011old sixth\u2011graders. I am so glad the club is back together again. For quite a while, we had to do without Stacey missing. In fact, Kristy (she\u2019s the club president) asked Jessi and me to join when Stacey\u2019s family moved from Stoneybrook back to New York City, which was where they\u2019d come from in the first place. (They\u2019d moved both times because Mr. McGill\u2019s company kept transferring him.) Then, after they moved back to New York, Mr. and Mrs. McGill decided to get divorced. They\u2019d been having problems for a while. So Mr. McGill stayed in New York with his job, and Mrs. McGill and Stacey returned to Stoneybrook. Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t move into their old house. Guess why? Jessi Ramsey\u2019s family had moved into it! But Stacey and her mom found a nice old house that they like \u2014 and it\u2019s right behind ours. If there weren\u2019t so many trees in the way, I\u2019d be able to look out our back windows and into Stacey\u2019s back windows. Maybe that will happen when the trees are bare. At any rate, it\u2019s nice to be able to walk out our back door, through our backyard, and right into Stacey\u2019s backyard.\n\nOn the day that Mom fixed the casserole, the McGills had been back for a week and a day. That meant that Stacey had been to three BSC meetings since her return \u2014 and, boy, were the rest of us glad to have her back.",

I\u2019m starting with her because she\u2019s the president of the club. She dreamed it up and got it going. Kristy is part of an interesting family. She has two older brothers, Sam and Charlie, who are in high school, and one much younger brother, David Michael. He\u2019s seven. Kristy\u2019s parents are divorced. They got divorced a long time ago and Kristy never sees her father. However, last summer her mother married this millionaire, Watson Brewer, who whisked the Thomases across town to his mansion. (Kristy used to live on Bradford Court, next to her best friend, Mary Anne Spier, and across the street from Claudia Kishi. But not anymore.) Watson has two little kids, Karen and Andrew, who are six and four. They\u2019re from his first marriage and live at the Brewer mansion every other weekend. (The rest of the time they live with their mother.) Kristy adores them. It\u2019s a full household \u2014 and even fuller since Nannie, Kristy\u2019s grandmother, moved in to help run the house after the Brewers adopted Emily Michelle, a two\u2011year\u2011old Vietnamese girl.\n\nKristy is brown\u2011haired, brown\u2011eyed, the shortest kid in her class, and doesn\u2019t care a bit about clothes.

What Dawn meant about her mother was that Mrs. Schafer is absentminded and scatterbrained. It\u2019s okay for me to say that because Dawn says it all the time.\n\nShe said it again now. \u201cMom is so scatterbrained!\u201d (Dawn had just found a high heel in the vegetable drawer of the refrigerator.) She removed it, set it gently on the floor, and said to the shoe, \u201cI hope you thaw out okay.\u201d Then she turned to me. \u201cWell? What do you want for dinner? I mean, besides shoes. Mom left a tofu casserole in the fridge \u2014 I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t leave it in her closet \u2014 but I have a feeling you won\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have any peanut butter?\u201d I asked hopefully.\n\n\u201cYes, but it\u2019s all natural, with no sugar or salt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d That was better than tofu.\n\nI made myself a peanut\u2011butter\u2011and\u2011honey sandwich while Dawn made herself a salad.\n\nWe were getting used to these evenings.

          "text": "I guess I should stop and explain who Dawn and I are before I tell you any more about our evening. Okay. Besides being best friends, we live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, and we\u2019re both thirteen years old and in eighth grade. My name is Mary Anne Spier. I\u2019ve lived in Stoneybrook all my life, in the same house, but Dawn moved here in the middle of seventh grade. She moved because her parents got divorced \u2014 and she moved all the way from California! She came with her mom and her younger brother, Jeff. The reason they chose to live in Stoneybrook was that Mrs. Schafer grew up here.\n\nOne really sad thing (I mean, apart from the divorce and the move), was that Jeff was never happy here. He couldn\u2019t adjust to Connecticut, and he missed California and his dad too much. So after awhile, he moved back there to live with Mr. Schafer. Dawn misses the California half of her family a lot, but she talks to them on the phone pretty often and seems happy in Connecticut now.\n\nAnyway, so Dawn was living here with her mom and no dad, and I\u2019d been living here with my dad and no mom (my mother died when I was really little), and one day the most amazing thing happened. When Dawn was unpacking the stuff her family had moved to Connecticut (and, as you can imagine, this took forever, since Mrs. Schafer wasn\u2019t much help), she came across her mother\u2019s high school yearbook. It was from her senior year, so of course she looked up her mom\u2019s picture. Then she looked up my dad\u2019s picture, since we knew they\u2019d gone to school together. And guess what we found out. Our parents had been in love years and years ago!\n\nBut their parents \u2014 well, Dawn\u2019s grandparents \u2014 didn\u2019t approve of the relationship. See, the Porters (Dawn\u2019s mom\u2019s name used to be Sharon Porter) were quite wealthy. And the Spiers were not, although \u2014 fake out \u2014 Dad put himself through law school and became pretty successful.\n\nAnyway, the Porters encouraged Dawn\u2019s mother to go to college in California (as far away as she could get from Dad), and my father and Dawn\u2019s mom finally went their separate ways. They each got married, and I think they even forgot about each other \u2014 sort of.\n\nThen Dawn and I reintroduced them and they began seeing each other again. At first they took things really slowly. Dad is this reserved, somewhat shy man who hadn\u2019t dated in years (not since he and my mother had dated), and he didn\u2019t want to rush into anything. Dawn\u2019s mom didn\u2019t want to rush into anything, either. But she loved dating again. She\u2019s very outgoing. For the longest time she went out with this awful, preppy guy whose nickname was Trip, and whom Dawn and Jeff hated and called the Trip\u2011Man. She went out with some other men, too. (That was because after she got a job, people at work kept fixing her up with their single friends.)\n\nAll along, though, she and Dad would see each other from time to time, but now they\u2019re the only people they date. And they go out a lot. That\u2019s why Dawn and I were so used to these evenings together. In fact, we weren\u2019t just used to them, we liked them!",

We don\u2019t get cable.\n\n\u201cA Hayley Mills festival.\u201d\n\nDawn just loves this kid who was an actress back in the sixties. Actually, I kind of like her, too. My favorite Hayley Mills movie is Pollyanna. Dawn\u2019s is The Parent Trap.\n\n\u201cA Hayley Mills festival?\u201d I repeated.\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d said Dawn jubilantly. \u201cThey\u2019re going to show Pollyanna, That Darn Cat, The Parent Trap, and The Moon\u2011Spinners.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll take hours!\u201d I cried.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d replied Dawn. \u201cI figure a good ten, if you count commercials and cable\u2011TV ads.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen does the festival start?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cRight now! So let\u2019s get our trays.\u201d\n\nThis is one thing I love about Dawn\u2019s house. You can eat in places other than the kitchen and the dining room. At my house there are a lot of rules. Dad used to have even more. He used to be really strict, but as I\u2019ve grown up, he\u2019s loosened up. However, I would never be allowed to eat dinner on a tray in front of the TV.\n\nSo I carried my sandwich and a banana into the den, and Dawn carried this bean\u2011sprout\u2011and\u2011chickpea salad into the den, and we sat down to eat and to get our fill of Hayley Mills. After about an hour, though, we\u2019d had our fill. The first movie shown was Pollyanna, and although we both like it, we\u2019d seen it recently.\n\n\u201cI guess there really is something to that saying about too much of a good thing,\u201d said Dawn.\n\nI nodded. \u201cYeah. Let\u2019s do something else.\u201d\n\nFirst we cleaned up our mess from dinner. (We didn\u2019t really need to, since Mrs. Schafer never notices messes, but we always feel we ought to.)

          "text": "Mom\u2019s wedding bouquet was flying through the air. Mary Anne, my new stepsister, and I were both leaping for it. At the last second, Mary Anne\u2019s arms seemed to grow about five inches, and even though she is not terribly coordinated, she caught the bouquet.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nThe bouquet was my mother\u2019s. I should have caught it. Well, that wasn\u2019t quite true. I don\u2019t know of any rule that says a daughter should catch her mom\u2019s bouquet. Plus, there were several people behind Mary Anne and me \u2014 several other women who wanted to catch it, too \u2014 and we were all supposed to have an equal shot at it. Why did we want to catch it so badly? Because there\u2019s this belief that if an unmarried woman catches the bride\u2019s bouquet after the bride has tossed it, that woman will be the next to get married.\n\nNow Mary Anne and I are only thirteen, so we didn\u2019t have any plans to get married, but I still thought I should have caught my own mother\u2019s bouquet. Anyway, I guess Mary Anne just tried a little harder than I did. After all, she\u2019s got a boyfriend. Logan Bruno. Maybe she hopes they\u2019ll get married someday, when they\u2019re older and ready for it.\n\nAnyway, Mary Anne was holding the bouquet triumphantly over her head. \"I caught it!\" she said with a gasp.\n\nWell, of course she\u2019d caught it. She\u2019d practically killed the rest of us in the process. I don\u2019t know why she was so surprised.\n\nEveryone was laughing and cheering.\n\n\"All right, Mary Anne!\" called Kristy Thomas, one of her best friends.\n\nI got into the spirit of things. Mary Anne is shy \u2014 extremely shy. And she\u2019s one of the nicest people I know. She\u2019s my best friend, she\u2019s now my stepsister, and she does have a boyfriend, while I don\u2019t. So I didn\u2019t mind too much that she\u2019d caught the bouquet. I found myself turning to her and giving her a big hug.\n\n\"Congratulations \u2026 sis!\" I said.\n\nMary Anne, the world\u2019s teariest person alive, immediately began to cry.\n\n\"Sis,\" she repeated. \"It\u2019s really true. We\u2019re stepsisters now.\"\n\n\"No, just sisters,\" I corrected her.\n\nMary Anne\u2019s tears flowed harder. \"Thanks \u2026 sis,\" she replied.",

          "text": "It was my mother\u2019s wedding day. Well, it was her second wedding day. Her first one had been sixteen years ago, when she married my father. About fourteen years later they had gotten divorced. We were living in California then \u2014 Mom; Dad; my younger brother, Jeff; and I. After the divorce, Mom moved Jeff and me here to Stoneybrook, Connecticut. She didn\u2019t choose Stoneybrook randomly. Stoneybrook is the town where she grew up, and her parents, my grandparents, were still living here. It was also the town where she had gone to school with a guy she liked a lot (although that didn\u2019t have anything to do with her decision to move back here). The guy\u2019s name was Richard Spier, and he is Mary Anne\u2019s father. She and Mr. Sp \u2014 I mean, Richard (Mary Anne and I had decided to call our stepparents by their first names, Richard and Sharon) had dated when they were in high school. But my grandparents hadn\u2019t approved of Richard. Mom\u2019s family had a lot of money; Richard\u2019s didn\u2019t. They said he came from the wrong side of the tracks. What soreheads. And they saw to it that after graduation, their daughter (my mother) got as far away from Richard as she could. They sent her to college in California. That\u2019s where she met and married my dad. Meanwhile, back here in Connecticut, Richard met and married Mary Anne\u2019s mom. He put himself through law school and got a good job (fake out on my grandparents), even though some terrible things happened. His parents died, Mary Anne\u2019s mother\u2019s parents died \u2014 and Mary Anne\u2019s mom died. It was awful. Mary Anne was quite young when she lost her mother and barely remembers her. Still, I think it must have been terrible to be almost alone in the world, just Richard and Mary Anne.\n\nBut fate intervened. (I read that sentence in a book once. Isn\u2019t it great?) Mom and Jeff and I moved back here, and in no time, Mary Anne and I not only met and became friends, but figured out that our parents had been in love years ago. We reintroduced them and \u2014 zap! They started dating and today they\u2019d gotten married. Finally. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if they\u2019d gotten married after high school. For one thing, Mary Anne and Jeff and I wouldn\u2019t be here, at least not in these particular bodies. That was a weird thought.\n\nI guess you probably want to know a little about the wedding. Well, since it was the second one for both Mom and Richard, they\u2019d kept it simple and small. Mom didn\u2019t even wear a wedding gown, just a gorgeous new dress. They got married in the chapel of a local church and didn\u2019t have any attendants. (Mary Anne and I were awfully disappointed. We\u2019d wanted to be bridesmaids.) The guests were three friends of my brother\u2019s (the Pike triplets), Mary Anne\u2019s and my friends from the Baby-sitters Club (I\u2019ll tell you more about the BSC later), some work friends of Mom\u2019s and Richard\u2019s, and my grandparents. Mary Anne\u2019s and my friends (just so you know) were: Kristy Thomas, Stacey McGill, Jessi Ramsey, Mallory Pike (she\u2019s the triplets\u2019 sister), Claudia Kishi, and Logan Bruno. Even though the wedding ceremony was short, it was pretty traditional. There were flowers at the altar, Mom and Richard said vows and exchanged rings, Richard kissed my mother on the lips in front of absolutely everybody, and Mom even wore something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.",

Emily was jumping up and down and crying. Well, she wasn\u2019t exactly jumping, since she can\u2019t get her feet off the ground yet. She was just doing fast knee\u2011bends. And her face was as red as a tomato.\n\n\"Wah\u2011ah\u2011ah\u2011ah\u2011ah\u2011ah,\" she wails in frustration.\n\nDavid Michael looked flustered. \"I did exactly what you told me to do,\" he said. \"I put the remote control up there,\" (he pointed to a shelf) \"and Emily began crying.\"\n\n\"Well, don\u2019t worry,\" I said. \"You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Look, here\u2019s your snack.\" I handed him half a sandwich. \"You eat that and I\u2019ll calm Emily down.\"",

          "text": "What a wild family I have. I love baby\u2011sitting for my little brothers and sisters (there are four of them all together \u2014 I\u2019ll explain that in a minute), but sometimes things can get touchy.\n\nDavid Michael sat at one end of the couch in the den, eating his sandwich, watching Gorilla Man, and occasionally casting wounded glances in my direction.\n\nMeanwhile, I tried to calm Emily down. I sat her on my lap in the armchair and explained that the remote control is for bigger people who know what all the buttons do. Then I said that it was polite to ask somebody if you could change channels before you actually did it. I purposely said that, instead of saying that what Emily had done was rude or wrong or bad. With children \u2014 or with anyone for that matter \u2014 it\u2019s much more helpful to tell them what to do instead of what not to do. Also, children are sensitive and I didn\u2019t want to hurt Emily\u2019s feelings.\n\nAll my talk was probably wasted, though. See, Emily is our adopted sister. She\u2019s two years old and she came to us from Vietnam. So first of all, she doesn\u2019t talk much, and second, she\u2019s just beginning to understand English.\n\nI told you I have a wild family. Here are the people in it: Mom; my stepfather, Watson Brewer; my seventeen\u2011year\u2011old brother, Charlie; my fifteen\u2011year\u2011old brother, Sam; David Michael (he\u2019s seven); Emily; Karen and Andrew, who are Watson\u2019s kids from his first marriage (Karen is seven and Andrew is almost five); and Nannie. Nannie is Mom\u2019s mother, my grandmother. She moved in with us after we adopted Emily. Nannie\u2019s husband had died years earlier, Nannie was tired of living alone, and we needed someone to help care for Emily, since both Mom and Watson work.\n\nAs you can imagine, we need a pretty big house for all these people. Luckily, Watson just happens to be a millionaire. Honest. He really is. So after he and Mom got married, my family moved across town to live in his mansion. The house is so big that everyone has his or her own room, even Karen and Andrew, who only live with us every other weekend.\n\nWhat happened to my real father? He walked out on Mom and my brothers and me not long after David Michael was born, and we hardly ever hear from him. He usually forgets our birthdays. Sometimes he even forgets to send us Christmas presents or cards. All I know about him now is that he\u2019s living in California somewhere. Or at least he was the last time he bothered to call. We live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, so my father is about as far away from us as he can get without leaving the continental United States.\n\nOh! I almost forgot! My name is Kristy Thomas and I\u2019m thirteen and in eighth grade. And there are two other members of the Brewer/Thomas household \u2014 Shannon, who is David Michael\u2019s puppy (she\u2019s a Bernese mountain dog), and Boo\u2011Boo, Watson\u2019s cat. Nobody except Watson likes Boo\u2011Boo very much. Boo\u2011Boo is old and fat and cranky. If you\u2019re not careful, he\u2019ll scratch or bite you. But for some reason, he likes Shannon.\n\nOn that particular afternoon, I was baby\u2011sitting because everyone else was busy. Mom and Watson were at their jobs, Charlie and Sam were at after\u2011school activities at Stoneybrook High School, and Nannie was at bowling practice. That is one of the things I just love about Nannie. She doesn\u2019t seem like a grandmother at all. Her hair is barely gray, she\u2019s got tons of energy and is always off bowling or visiting friends or something, and she drives this rattly old car, which she painted pink and named the Pink Clinker. Recently, she attached a fake tail to the back of her car so that it looks like a cat is stuck in the trunk. (Charlie and Sam are embarrassed to be seen riding in the Pink Clinker.)\n\nWhen David Michael and Emily had calmed down and been playing happily for awhile, I checked my watch. It was almost five o\u2019clock. Soon Nannie would come home, and then Charlie and Sam would arrive from school. Charlie bought a used car not long ago so he can drive himself and Sam to school every day. The two of them think they are pretty cool.\n\nA little while later I heard Emily\u2019s bare feet running through the house, and her cries of, \"Nannie! Nannie!\" (\"Nannie\" is an easy word to say.)",

Good\u2011bye, everyone!\" I shouted. It was time for the changing of the guards. Nannie would begin fixing dinner, and Sam would watch Emily and David Michael.\n\nI dashed out to Charlie\u2019s car.

          "text": "Click, click, click.\n\nI watched the second hand on the clock in the front of my classroom work its way slowly around and around the dial. When the room was silent, as it was then, every time the hand on the clock jumped forward one second, it made a clicking sound.\n\nIt was a faithful old clock. You could depend on it. Every afternoon it clicked its way from 1:10 to 1:51, and when that second hand clicked over to the twelve at precisely 1:51, the bell rang \u2014 and I was released from the horrors of science class.\n\nI absolutely can\u2019t stand science, especially biology, which was what we were studying. I couldn\u2019t keep all those terms straight \u2014 cell and nucleus, species and phylum and genus, RNA and DNA and who knows what else. You know what is really stupid? The word species. If you have two different kinds of animals or something, then you have two species. But if you have only one kind, then you still have a species. Why not a specie? Or a specy? You don\u2019t have two cats and one cats.\n\nOh, well.\n\nClick, click, click.\n\nWe were supposed to be reading the instructions for an experiment we were going to perform in class that day. Now there\u2019s another stupid thing. Year after year, this same teacher makes his students perform the same experiments. Well, if the experiments have been done so many times before, how can they still be experiments? The teacher knows what is going to happen. I thought experimenting meant trying new things to see what would happen. We weren\u2019t experimenting at all. We were playacting.\n\nBut none of this really mattered. I, Claudia Kishi, was just biding my time. I was not going to have to perform the experiment that day. I was simply waiting for the clock to click to 1:20. Then I got to \u2026 leave early! I couldn\u2019t wait.\n\nWell, I couldn\u2019t wait to leave science class. I could wait for what I had to do after I left. What did I have to do? I had to go to an awards ceremony at which my older sister, Janine the Genius, was going to be given some big honor. As if she isn\u2019t always being awarded for something. Every time I turn around she\u2019s getting another certificate or prize, or she\u2019s made the honor roll or gotten straight A\u2019s again.\n\nMy sister and I sure are different. It\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019re related. I never get awards. Okay, I\u2019ve gotten a few awards, but they were for my artwork. I\u2019m proud of the awards, and my parents are, too, I think, but Janine just stands out when it comes to schoolwork. Maybe I should tell you a little about my family so you can understand things better.\n\nTo begin with, there are four people in my family \u2014 Mom, Dad, Janine, and me. Janine is sixteen and a junior at Stoneybrook High School, otherwise known as SHS. (We live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut.) I am thirteen and in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School, or SMS. There used to be a fifth person in our family \u2014 my grandmother Mimi. Mimi and I were very close. I could tell her anything. She always listened to me, and she didn\u2019t care that I\u2019m not such a hot student. She really liked my art, too. But now Mimi is gone. She died a little while ago. I miss her a lot.\n\nOur family is Japanese-American. Janine and I were born right here in Stoneybrook, though. We\u2019ve never even been to Japan. My dad is a partner in an investment firm in Stamford, which is a city nearby. My mom is the head librarian at our local public library. I\u2019m stupid and Janine is a genius. Oh, okay. I know that isn\u2019t true. I mean, about my being stupid. According to my teachers I\u2019m very smart. I just don\u2019t apply myself. I have a little trouble concentrating, and frankly, school doesn\u2019t interest me. But art does. I love everything about art. And I\u2019m good at it. I can sculpt, paint, sketch, make collages and jewelry, you name it. I\u2019m not bragging. This is just the way things are.\n\nThen there\u2019s Janine. She doesn\u2019t care about anything except school. She especially likes computers and science. She\u2019s a true and honest genius. She has a genius IQ \u2014 over 150. She\u2019s so smart that even though she\u2019s only in high school, she gets to take some classes at the community college. She\u2019s been doing that for two years now.\n\nJanine and I are as different as night and day.",

Just when everyone was finishing reading the instructions for the \u201cexperiment,\u201d the second hand on the clock hit 1:20.\n\nI jumped up.\n\n\u201cI have to go now,\u201d I reminded my teacher.\n\n\u201cOkay. See you tomorrow, Claudia,\u201d he replied. (It was only Monday, the beginning of a new week of amoebas and paramecia and other biological things.)\n\nI gathered up my stuff, dashed out of the classroom and to my locker, where I put away my science text, took out two other books, and grabbed my jacket. Then I raced to the front of SMS.\n\nMy father was waiting for me.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d I said, as I climbed into his car.\n\n\u201cHi, honey,\u201d he replied.\n\nDad drove through Stoneybrook to the high school. We were going to meet my mother there. I couldn\u2019t believe that both of my parents had left their jobs for this awards ceremony. (Well, Mom was going back to hers afterward, since it\u2019s so close by, but Dad wasn\u2019t. Stamford is too far away.)\n\nWhen we reached the high school, Dad parked our car and we walked to the main entrance of the building. There we found Mom, Peaches, and Russ waiting for us. Peaches and Russ are my aunt and uncle. (Peaches is Mom\u2019s sister.) I love them. They are totally cool and funny. Real characters. Russ is American. I mean, he\u2019s not Japanese. And he\u2019s the one who came up with the name Peaches. See, Mimi gave Mom and Peaches Japanese names, but Russ started calling my aunt Peaches, and it sort of stuck. Now everybody calls her Peaches. And everybody just calls Russ, Russ. Not even Russell, which is his full first name. Janine and I don\u2019t even call them Aunt Peaches and Uncle Russ. They\u2019re Peaches and Russ to the whole world. They don\u2019t have any children (I think maybe they can\u2019t have any), but I wish they did. They would be neat parents.\n\nMom and Dad a",

          "text": "I was so excited I felt like doing cartwheels across Claudia Kishi\u2019s bedroom floor. It was summer (at last!) and my friends and I were gathered for a special meeting of the Baby-sitters Club.\n\nI looked around the room, and it was pretty obvious that my friends were as excited as I was. Of course, everyone was trying very hard to be cool, because that\u2019s the way our club president, Kristy Thomas, expects us to be.\n\nEven though we were starting our summer vacations, she insisted on business as usual. Kristy was perched in a director\u2019s chair, wearing a red T-shirt, faded jeans, and a visor. She glanced at her watch just as our two junior officers, Mallory Pike and Jessi Ramsey, scooted into the room and flopped down on the floor.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Kristy said sternly.\n\nJessi and Mal are younger than the rest of us (and happen to be best friends) but Kristy believes that rules are rules. She takes her duty as president very seriously and believes that nothing \u2014 short of an earthquake \u2014 is an excuse for being late. But I can understand why she feels that way. The Baby-sitters Club was her idea, and I can still remember the day she told Claudia and me about it. All of us had grown up together on Bradford Court and loved to baby-sit, but it took someone like Kristy to set the wheels in motion for an actual sitting business.\n\nBut back to Mal and Jessi. \u201cSorry,\u201d they murmured in unison. They looked like they were trying hard not to giggle. Mal and Jessi always stick together, and besides, how could anyone take things seriously on the first day of summer?\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to California tonight,\u201d I whispered to Dawn Schafer. Dawn is my stepsister (her mother married my father), and she was going to the West Coast to visit her father and brother for two weeks.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it, either. It will be so much fun to go home. I mean, to my second home,\u201d she added quickly.\n\nHer second home? I guess I should explain that. Even though she lives in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, now, Dawn is a California girl at heart. She loves the sun and the ocean, and is into health food in a major way. She even looks like someone out of a California beach movie. If you\u2019ve already guessed that she\u2019s blonde, blue-eyed, and has the kind of dazzling smile you see in toothpaste commercials \u2014 you\u2019re right! Besides being my stepsister, Dawn is my \u201cother\u201d best friend. (Kristy Thomas is also my best friend.) There was definitely some jealousy involved when Dawn and I became stepsisters. Kristy seemed hurt that Dawn and I were spending so much time together, and I had to reassure her that it wouldn\u2019t affect our friendship.\n\nI just realized I haven\u2019t told you who I am, so here\u2019s a capsule biography, as my English teacher would say. My name is Mary Anne Spier. I am thirteen years old and an eighth-grader at Stoneybrook Middle School. I don\u2019t have a yard of wheat-colored hair like Dawn. Instead, I have brown hair, brown eyes, and think of myself as kind of ordinary. Oh, yes, one more thing. I have a fantastic gray kitten named Tigger.\n\n\u201cHave you said good-bye to Logan?\u201d Dawn asked in a low voice.\n\n\u201cI called him last night.\u201d\n\nI knew it would be hard to say good-bye to Logan, so I had decided to get it over with quickly. Logan Bruno is my boyfriend, but I still have a little trouble getting used to the idea. Logan is the cutest boy I have ever seen. He looks just like Cam Geary, my favorite TV star, and he comes from Louisville, Kentucky. He has this smooth southern accent and a voice that makes me think of warm molasses. Logan is an associate member of the BSC, which means he doesn\u2019t come to meetings, but he fills in occasionally when all the regular members are busy. (Our other associate member is Shannon Kilbourne, a friend of Kristy\u2019s.)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really going to miss you,\u201d Dawn said softly. \u201cBut I guess the feeling is mutual.\u201d\n\nI nodded. Even though I had a wonderful two weeks at Sea City, this fantastic beach in New Jersey, ahead of me, I knew I would miss Logan. A lot.\n\n\u201cCan we please come to order?\u201d Kristy said abruptly. I glanced around the room as the meeting began. It\u2019s amazing how many good things have happened for me because of the Baby-sitters Club. Dawn feels the same way. When we became friends, which was right after she moved here from California, I talked the BSC members into letting her join the club. About a year later we became stepsisters. But you\u2019re probably wondering how the club got started, and this would be a good time to tell you a little bit about it.\n\nOne day Kristy noticed that her mom was having a terrible time trying to find a sitter for David Michael, Kristy\u2019s little brother. Kristy couldn\u2019t sit for him, and neither could her two older brothers. So Mrs. Thomas was making calls all over town and getting nowhere. Then Kristy had a great idea. Why not form a baby-sitters club to solve that kind of problem?\n\nThis is how it works. A group of us meet on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 5:30 to 6:00 in Claudia Kishi\u2019s bedroom. Why did we pick Claudia\u2019s room? Because she has her own phone and her own private number. Anyone who wants a baby-sitter can call us at that time, and they immediately reach seven sitters at once. The idea is perfect \u2014 and so simple, we wondered why we hadn\u2019t thought of it before.\n\nKristy is the president, because the club was her idea, and Claudia is the vice-president, since her room is our headquarters. Stacey McGill likes numbers, so she\u2019s our treasurer. My stepsister, Dawn, is our official alternate officer. Dawn has to be familiar with the job of every club officer and be able to substitute for anyone who can\u2019t make a meeting. She really likes being an alternate because she gets to take on lots of different roles in the club.\n\nMal and Jessi are junior officers as I mentioned. Since they are eleven years old, they can only baby-sit after school and on weekends, but they are very responsible. (They don\u2019t have actual club duties, though.) Mal and Jessi have a lot in common",

          "text": "As the train started up, I sat back in my seat, leaned my head against the window, and smiled to myself. On the surface it might seem as if I, eighth\u2011grader Stacey McGill, had the perfect life. Most of the time I live in lovely old Stoneybrook, Connecticut. That\u2019s where my train was headed. I go to a great school, have tons of friends, and belong to the best club in the world \u2014 but more about that later.\n\nEvery now and then, though \u2014 pretty much whenever I feel like it \u2014 I get to go on a \u201cFun\u2011Filled Action\u2011Packed All\u2011Expenses\u2011Paid Weekend in the Glamorous Big Apple, New\u202fYork City!\u201d as they say on the game shows.\n\nThat\u2019s how it looks on the surface. And, I\u2019ll admit, I had just had a terrific weekend in New\u202fYork. But as soon as you peek beneath the surface of my life, you\u2019ll see that it isn\u2019t quite as ideal as it looks. Maybe you\u2019ve guessed by now that the reason I go back and forth between Stoneybrook and New\u202fYork is that my parents are divorced. When they broke up, my mom and I moved to Stoneybrook, and my dad stayed in the city. The split happened pretty recently, and believe me, it was not Fun\u2011Filled, although it was kind of Action\u2011Packed. Before they split up, my parents fought a lot \u2014 not physically or anything, but all that yelling really got to me.\n\nHow did my mom and I end up in Stoneybrook? Well, that\u2019s kind of complicated, but here goes. I grew up in New\u202fYork City, and in a way I\u2019ll always consider it my home. I love all the excitement. I also love eating out, going to shows, and \u2026 shopping! There\u2019s no place like New\u202fYork for great clothes. I still shop there, which means I look pretty sophisticated in Stoneybrook. For example, I had dressed for my train ride in a white jumpsuit, layered over a blue tank top. I had on white push\u2011down socks with blue hearts all over them, a wide blue patent leather belt, and a wild necklace made of all kinds of plastic sea creatures in a rainbow of colors.\n\nOops. I think I got off the track there a little. Where was I? Okay, so I grew up in New\u202fYork, but then when I was in seventh grade my dad\u2019s company transferred him to their Connecticut office. And then, a year later, just as I\u2019d really begun to feel at home in Stoneybrook, they transferred him back to New\u202fYork. Can you believe it?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after we\u2019d moved back to the city that I noticed how my parents seemed to be fighting all the time. And you can guess the rest of the story. They decided to get divorced, I decided to move back to Stoneybrook with my mom (instead of moving to the Upper East Side with my dad), and that\u2019s why I was on that train, thinking about my weekend in New\u202fYork.",

          "text": "The first great thing about the weekend was that my dad had taken the whole day off on Saturday just to be with me. I know, you\u2019re thinking, What\u2019s the big deal? Nobody works on Saturday. Nobody except my dad. I guess he\u2019s what you\u2019d call a workaholic. That was one of the things he and my mom used to fight about: how his job was more important to him than his family, how he was never home\u2026. But on this Saturday, I guess it was important to him to show me a good time, because that\u2019s what he did.\n\nWe started the day by going out to brunch, to this little caf\u00e9 I\u2019ve always loved. All the waiters are really cute, and you can get any kind of omelette you want. The food is excellent, but what I really love is the cappuccino. (That\u2019s coffee with foamy hot milk in it and cinnamon sprinkled on top. Yum.) I\u2019m not usually allowed to drink coffee, but my dad always lets me have a little of his cappuccino.\n\nAfter brunch we just walked around for awhile, window shopping and people watching. You never know who or what you\u2019ll see in New\u202fYork. At one point, as we were crossing Fifth Avenue, I looked to my right just in time to see Gary Rockman (he is the hottest \u2014 and most gorgeous \u2014 star around right now) jump into a cab. I nearly died!\n\nMy dad knows that one of my favorite stores is Fiorucci, so when we got near it he suggested that we go in. He told me to pick out anything I wanted. For a second, I considered taking him at his word and asking him to buy me this outrageous purple suede jacket. Was it beautiful! Cropped short at the waist and covered with fringe all up the arms and across the back. But I did the mature thing (silly me!) and picked out a wild pair of sunglasses \u2014 heart\u2011shaped ones, in a black\u2011and\u2011white checkerboard pattern. Claudia (my best friend in Stoneybrook) will love them, I know.\n\nWe walked and shopped some more, and by 5:00 we were starving, so we decided to go out for dinner. Dad let me choose the restaurant, so I picked Hunan Supreme, this Chinese place in our old neighborhood. We know the owner there, Mr. Lee, and the food is great.\n\nOur meal was delicious, but I have to say that dinner was not my favorite part of the weekend.",

I\u2019m a diabetic. I have to be really careful about what I eat, when I eat it, and how many calories it has. If I\u2019m not careful, my blood sugar gets all out of whack, and I can get seriously ill. I also have to take insulin every day. I give myself the shots, which sounds horrible, but it really is no big deal once you get used to it. When I first got diabetes, my parents were constantly fussing over me. They made me nuts. But by now they basically know that I know how to take care of myself.\n\nUnfortunately, though, I\u2019d recently been told by my regular doctor that I\u2019d have to be even more careful with my diet and with taking just the right amount of insulin. I guess my body is going through some changes right now that make it hard for everything to stay in balance.\n\nSo there I was, about to take another bite of my noodles. I do know that they\u2019re okay for me to eat, of course; otherwise I\u2019d never have ordered them. Who wants to g",

          "text": "Usually my mom comes to get me, but that day I waited and waited. Finally, fifteen minutes after everyone else had left, my dad drove up. He works in Stamford, but my lessons usually end long before he\u2019s ready to leave the office.\n\nI ran to his car.\n\n\"Daddy!\" I cried. \"How come you\u2019re picking me up? Where\u2019s Mama? Did something happen to Becca or Squirt?\"\n\nBecca is my younger sister. She\u2019s eight. Squirt is my baby brother. His real name is John Philip Ramsey, Jr., but since he was the smallest baby in the hospital when he was born, the nurses started calling him Squirt. And the name stuck, even though now Squirt is the same size as most other toddlers his age.\n\nDaddy smiled at me. \"Don\u2019t worry,\" he said, as I slid into the front seat of the car. \"Everyone\u2019s fine. I decided to leave work early today, so I called your mother and told her I\u2019d bring you home. It would be silly for her to make the trip when I\u2019m already here.\"\n\n\"Why\u2019d you leave early?\" I wanted to know. And just then a smell (well, not a smell; a wonderful chocolaty aroma) drifted to me. I turned around and saw a white bakery box on the backseat. \"Hey, what\u2019s that?\"\n\n\"You\u2019re certainly full of questions today,\" remarked Daddy. \"Let\u2019s see. I left early because we have something to celebrate tonight, and the box in the backseat is part of the celebration.\"\n\n\"A celebration? Oh, goody!\" I cried, reaching for the box.\n\n\"No peeking,\" said Daddy.\n\n\"But I want to see what\u2019s in there.\"\n\n\"The celebration is a surprise. You\u2019ll find out all about it after dinner.\"\n\nI couldn\u2019t help guessing. \"You got a promotion!\" I exclaimed.\n\nDaddy shook his head.\n\n\"You got a raise.\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re moving back to New Jersey?\"\n\nI wasn\u2019t quite as excited by that idea. The funny thing is, a few months ago, I would have jumped at the chance to leave Stoneybrook and return to Oakley, New Jersey, the town in which I grew up. My family and I had been happy there. We are black, and our neighborhood, school, and even my ballet school in Oakley were all mixed up \u2014 black people and white people, living and working together. Plus, my relatives lived nearby. One of my cousins, Keisha, was my best friend. When Daddy\u2019s company offered him a better job in Stamford, he jumped at the chance. But it meant we had to move. I did not want to leave Oakley. But I was not prepared for what would greet us in Stoneybrook \u2014 prejudice, that\u2019s what. We moved to a town with only a few black residents. I am the only black student in the entire sixth grade. People teased my family. People said nasty things to us. People ignored us.\n\nAt first.\n\nSlowly, though, a change came about. I made some friends. They became good friends. Becca and I each made a best friend. Now I can\u2019t see going back to Oakley. I\u2019d have to leave too many memories behind \u2014 like my baby-sitting adventures. Or the time our whole school went on a trip to a ski lodge in Vermont. Or the time my friends and I went to summer camp.\n\nBut luckily Daddy said, \"No, we\u2019re not moving.\"\n\nThen it struck me. \"You\u2019re having a baby, aren\u2019t you? You and Mama are having a baby! Oh, I hope it\u2019s another boy. Then our family would be even. Two girls, two boys.\"\n\nDadddy chuckled. \"It\u2019s not a new baby, either,\" he said. \"And why don\u2019t you stop guessing? I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll give it away if you really do guess it.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, but I continued guessing in my head. We had won the lottery. We were taking a trip to Disney World \u2014 or maybe even Texas. I had always wanted to see Texas. Then I got another idea. I bet Mama and Daddy really were having a baby, but Daddy was too smart to let on.\n\nAll the way to Stoneybrook, I hugged the secret to myself.",

          "text": "But back to the story. I glanced around Kristy Thomas\u2019s bedroom and saw that all six of my friends were experimenting with lipstick and nail polish. A few of them, like Stacey McGill, were even trying out new hairstyles. It was a sort of mass \u201cmake-over,\u201d and there was a lot of giggling going on. (And some of the \u201cbefores\u201d looked better than the \u201cafters,\u201d if you know what I mean.)\n\nI guess I should stop here and introduce everybody before I tell you anything else about the sleepover at Kristy\u2019s. First of all, the seven of us are members of the Baby-sitters Club (or BSC), which I\u2019ll explain about later. My name is Dawn Schafer, and I am the alternate officer of the club. I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, and I am thirteen years old. My friends all say I look like a California girl with my long blonde hair and sparkly blue eyes. This makes sense since I lived in California before my parents got divorced and my mom and my brother Jeff and I moved to Stoneybrook. Now Jeff lives in California again with my father (he just wasn\u2019t happy in Connecticut), and sometimes I go back to visit. What else would you like to know? Well, I love the outdoors, I\u2019m a vegetarian, and I try to eat a healthy diet. (Unlike Claudia, who thinks Gummi Bears are nature\u2019s perfect food.)\n\nClaudia is a beautiful, dramatic-looking Japanese-American who loves exotic clothes. (She\u2019s also the vice-president of the BSC.) Claudia\u2019s one of those people who can wear anything and get away with it. Today, for example, she had stuck to two colors: black and white. Black cotton bib overalls over a white turtleneck with a shiny black patent leather belt looped around her waist. Black suede ankle boots and white cotton socks. Long black hair swept off her face with giant white plastic barrettes. Anyone else would look like a penguin in that get-up, but Claudia looked great.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked, holding up a white hoop earring next to her face. \u201cToo much?\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cMaybe just a little.\u201d The earring was the size of a doorknob.\n\n\u201cHey, Dawn, will you take a look at my hair?\u201d asked Mary Anne. Mary Anne Spier is my stepsister (my mother married Richard, her father) and she is also my best friend. Mary Anne is a lot less daring with clothes and makeup than I am, but she has grown up quite a bit in the past year.\n\nWhen I first met Mary Anne, she looked like a little girl. She was wearing little-girl clothes and, worst of all, she was wearing her brown hair in two long pigtails. Awful! When I got to know her better, I realized that she\u2019s really sweet and very sensitive, and that she dressed that way because her father picked out her clothes. See, Mary Anne\u2019s mother died when Mary Anne was just a baby, so her father has always been very protective of her. Luckily, he\u2019s loosened up a lot since he married my mom, and Mary Anne looks like a regular thirteen-year-old now. And she even has a steady boyfriend. She\u2019s the only one of us BSC members who can make that claim. Her boyfriend is named Logan Bruno, and he\u2019s part of the club, too. Mary Anne is the club secretary.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d I asked, scooting over to her side of the room. The minute the words were out of my mouth, I knew the answer.\n\nStacey McGill (a real New York girl) was busily \u201cscrunching\u201d Mary Anne\u2019s long brown hair into a tangled mane that trailed down her back. Very hip, very in, but not very \u201cMary Anne.\u201d I thought it looked fantastic, but I knew that Mary Anne was unhappy with it. Mary Anne usually wears her hair in a smooth style; she\u2019s used to seeing herself in a certain way. (I should explain that Mary Anne would never complain to Stacey, because she doesn\u2019t like to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings.)\n\n\u201cHonestly, Mary Anne, if you\u2019d just keep your hands out of the way, this would go a lot quicker.\u201d Stacey had scrunched her own hair into a cloud of blonde curls and was trying for the same effect with my stepsister.\n\nMary Anne shot me a desperate look in the mirror, just as Stacey gave a final pat to her hair and said pointedly, \u201cDoesn\u2019t she look great?\u201d\n\nI was on the spot. \u201cI think it\u2019s a nice change,\u201d I began. \u201cOf course, you wouldn\u2019t have to wear it that way every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe should. It\u2019s a big improvement,\u201d Stacey said flatly. Stacey McGill, the club treasurer, is very fashion-conscious and always wears the newest, trendiest clothes. She is sophisticated, like Claudia (who happens to be her best friend), and she has boyfriends sometimes, but no steady ones. She\u2019s an only child and grew up in New York City until her father\u2019s company transferred him to Connecticut. The McGills had lived in Stoneybrook for a year when her father was sent back to New York. We all said tearful good-byes to Stacey and wondered if we would ever see her again. About a year later, Stacey\u2019s parents got divorced, and Stacey and her mom returned to Connecticut. Talk about a complicated life! Stacey still seems like a New York girl at heart (just like I am a California girl at heart) and she visits her father in New York whenever she can.\n\nJust to add to Stacey\u2019s problems, she has a sever",

Then I raised my voice. \u201cKeep your eye on the ball!\u201d I yelled.\n\nI must have startled Jackie Rodowsky because he swung way too low and missed an easy pitch.\n\n\u201cStrike two!\u201d shouted the umpire.\n\n\u201cDarn,\u201d I muttered. I went back to murmuring, \u201cConcentrate, concentrate.\u201d\n\nIt was almost the end of another game between the Krushers and the Bashers. Who are the Krushers and the Bashers? They\u2019re softball teams here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I am the coach of the Krushers. Bart Taylor is the coach of the Bashers.\n\nI have a crush on Bart.\n\nAnyway, for the first time in the history of softball games between my Krushers and Bart\u2019s Bashers, it looked like the Krushers had a chance to win. See, the Krushers are not your average softball team. The players are all kids who are too young or too scared to try out for T-ball or Little League. In other words, as you might have guessed, they aren\u2019t great players. (Well, most of them aren\u2019t.) One kid ducks every time a ball comes toward him. Most of the kids are not good hitters. We even have one player who\u2019s only two and a half years old. We let her use a special ball and bat so she doesn\u2019t get hurt, and we have to tell her everything to do. But you know what? She\u2019s a pretty good hitter for her age.\n\nBart\u2019s Bashers, on the other hand, are an older, tougher group of kids. (I don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t just join Little League. Maybe they like having Bart as their coach. I could certainly understand that.) The thing is, the Bashers have always beaten the Krushers easily.\n\nUntil now.\n\nNow the score was tied, the Krushers had been playing very well, the bases were loaded, and it was the bottom of the ninth \u2014 with two outs. The only problem was that the Krushers were up, and our batter was Jackie Rodowsky, the walking disaster. Poor Jackie. I love him to bits, but he is a walking disaster. He\u2019s accident\u2011prone, he has bad luck, and he\u2019s not too coordinated.\n\nThe pitcher looked nervous, though. After all, the game was tied, and the Bashers had never been beaten by the Krushers.\n\nStill, this was the walking disaster at bat. \u201cCome on, come on,\u201d I muttered, and gave Jackie the thumbs\u2011up sign.\n\nThe pitcher threw the ball, Jackie swung his bat, and \u2014 he hit a home run! Four more runs.\n\n\u201cWe won! We won!\u201d the Krushers screamed.\n\nI screamed right along with them, even though I knew the Bashers had been playing under handicaps. Their best hitter had the chicken pox, their usual pitcher was out of town for the weekend, and two good players had been benched for fighting (with each other).\n\nStill, the Krushers were victorious, and our cheerleaders went wild. \u201cWe won! We won! We won!\u201d they couldn\u2019t stop yelling. Then they remembered their softball manners and shouted, \u201cTwo, four, six, eight! Who do we appreciate? The Bashers! The Bashers! Yea!\u201d\n\nI had a feeling this was the first time our cheerleaders actually meant what they were saying.\n\nOur cheerleaders, by the way, are Vanessa Pike and Haley Braddock, who are nine, and Charlotte Johanssen, who\u2019s eight. Haley\u2019s brother, Matt, is a Krusher. He\u2019s profoundly deaf, but he\u2019s one of our best players. We communicate with him using sign language. Several of Vanessa\u2019s brothers and sisters (she has seven) are on the team, including her littlest sister, Claire, who\u2019s five and sometimes throws tantrums, shouting, \u201cNofe\u2011air! Nofe\u2011air! Nofe\u2011air!\u201d when she thinks she\u2019s been wronged.",

Honest.\u201d And, \u201cWe finally won a game!\u201d\n\nThen I looked across the schoolyard to where my big brother Charlie was waiting to drive me and my little brothers and sister home. (Charlie is seventeen, can drive, and has this awful old secondhand car. At least it runs.)\n\nWho am I? I\u2019m Kristy Thomas. I\u2019m thirteen and I\u2019m an eighth\u2011grader at Stoneybrook Middle School (SMS). I have three brothers, a stepbrother and stepsister, and an adopted sister. David Michael, my seven\u2011year\u2011old brother, and Karen and Andrew, my stepsister and stepbrother, who are seven and four, are Krushers. Charlie was going to drop Karen and Andrew off at their mother\u2019s house and then take David Michael and me home. This was nice of him. We could have walked, but we had an awful lot of equipment.\n\nCharlie and I were just loading the last of it into the back of his car, when a voice said, \u201cCan I walk you home?\u201d I whirled around. It was Bart. My heart flip\u2011flopped. It actually felt like it turned over inside my chest. I tried to breathe slowly.\n\n\u201cCharlie?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs that okay with you? You can leave the stuff in the car and I\u2019ll help you unload it as soon as I get home.\u201d\n\nNo problem,\u201d replied Charlie. (He is so good\u2011natured.) \u201cOkay, see you later, David Michael. Karen and Andrew, I\u2019ll see you Friday afternoon.\u201d (Karen and Andrew only live with their dad and my mom and the rest of our family every other weekend. Oh, and for two weeks during the summer. The rest of the time they live with their mother and stepfather.)\n\n\u201c\u2019Bye!\u201d called David Michael, Karen and Andrew, who were still practically hysterical over beating the Bashers.\n\nCharlie drove off in his rattly car.",

I have long black hair and almond\u2011shaped eyes (I\u2019m Japanese\u2011American) and in case you haven\u2019t already figured it out, I\u2019m not what you would call a scholar. In fact, the test I was studying for was in remedial math. That\u2019s right. I can\u2019t seem to keep up with the rest of my class, at least in certain subjects. I try hard, but maybe not hard enough. The fact is, I\u2019m just not too crazy about things like math and science.\n\nWhat am I crazy about? I\u2019ll tell you. First on my list is art. I love drawing, painting, sculpting, making things out of papier\u2011m\u00e2ch\u00e9, making collages, making jewelry \u2026 well, you get the picture.\n\nNext, I love my family. We\u2019re pretty close. There\u2019s just Mom and Dad and Janine and me. My dad\u2019s an investment banker, my mom\u2019s a librarian, and my sister, Janine, is a genius. I mean it! She\u2019s a junior at Stoneybrook High, but she\u2019s taking college courses already. It\u2019s, well, it\u2019s interesting to have a genius in the family. More about Janine later.\n\nMimi, the one in the picture, was my grandmother. (Of course she wasn\u2019t my grandmother yet when that picture was taken.) She died not long ago, but I love that photo of her as a young girl. She looked a lot like me way back then.\n\nI miss Mimi all the time. How can I explain how wonderful she was? Always calm, always gentle \u2014 that was Mimi. She understood me better than anyone else ever has. Sometimes I just can\u2019t believe that I\u2019ll really never see her again. But she\u2019ll always be in my heart, and just thinking of her and looking at her picture can make me feel close to her.",

          "text": "Now, where was I? Oh, right. Things that I\u2019m crazy about. Well, I love to baby\u2011sit \u2014 so much so that I belong to a club called the Baby\u2011sitters Club \u2014 but more about that later, too. I also love to read Nancy Drew mysteries, and I adore junk food. Doritos, M&M\u2019s, Twinkies \u2014 I never say no to any of it.\n\nMy parents, however, don\u2019t like me to read Nancy Drew books (they would prefer that I read \u201cclassics\u201d) and they really don\u2019t like me to eat junk food. (\u201cProper nutrition is important \u2026\u201d You know the line.)\n\nSo I\u2019ve learned to hide my secret vices. The Nancy Drew books get stuck under my mattress, or on the top shelf of my closet, or underneath a pile of dirty clothes. The junk food gets stashed anywhere and everywhere \u2014 it\u2019s always turning up where I least expect it. Last night, for example, when I was looking for my favorite watercolor set, I found a box of Milk Duds that I had hidden about three months ago. (They were still good.)\n\nOn this night, though, I wasn\u2019t eating any junk food or reading Nancy Drew books. I was studying for a big test, a huge test, a killer test. This math test was going to count for a big part of my final grade. I just had to do well on it.\n\nJanine was helping me study. It\u2019s kind of a rule in my family (my parents\u2019 idea) that somebody has to help me with my homework every night. Mimi used to be my favorite helper of all. She never got impatient with me, she never made me feel dumb, and even though she didn\u2019t often tell me so, I always knew that she was very, very proud of whatever I did.\n\nJanine is a different story.\n\nIt\u2019s not that she\u2019s mean or anything \u2014 but I just don\u2019t think she has any idea of what school is like for me. See, she loves school. She\u2019d go to school eight days a week if she could. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever gotten any grade lower than an A\u2013. And you should see the classes she takes! I don\u2019t even understand the names of most of them \u2014 especially the computer ones.\n\nAnd here she is, helping me try to understand how Gertrude measures chocolate \u2014 and why. She must think I\u2019m so dumb. I know it\u2019s really nice of her to help me, but I sure wish I didn\u2019t need her \u2014 or anyone\u2019s \u2014 help.\n\nI looked back at my math book. All those fractions were kind of making me dizzy. Janine was being unusually patient. She knew this test was important to me.\n\n\u201cSo how do you like Mr. Zorzi, Claudia?\u201d she asked. Mr. Zorzi is my math teacher \u2014 at least he is for now. See, my regular teacher is out for a few weeks, recovering from an operation, so we have Mr. Zorzi as a long\u2011term substitute.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s okay, I guess. I\u2019ve had him before. He knows it takes me awhile to catch on to some of this stuff,\u201d I said, nodding toward my messy notebook.\n\nFrankly, I never think too much about my teachers and whether I like them or not. I just do my best to get through most of my classes without making a total fool of myself. Janine, however, just loves some of her teachers \u2014 and all of them think that she\u2019s the greatest.\n\nSometimes I get so tired of teachers asking me, \u201cClaudia Kishi? Are you Janine\u2019s sister? Well, I know I can expect some wonderful work from you, if you\u2019re anything like Janine.\u201d Of course, they\u2019re always disappointed. Except my art teachers.

          "text": "\"How do I look?\" I asked.\n\n\"Look? You look just fine,\" replied Dawn. \"Anyway, you\u2019re only going to baby\u2011sit for Jenny. What\u2019s the big deal?\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know. I guess Mrs. Prezzioso is the big deal. You know how she\u2019s always dressed. And how she always dresses Jenny.\"\n\n\"Yeah. They look like contestants in a mother\u2011daughter beauty pageant.\"\n\nDawn and I giggled. Dawn is not only one of my two best friends; she\u2019s my stepsister. It was a Friday night and I was getting ready to sit for Jenny. Dawn was perched on a chair in my room.\n\n\"You know what?\" I went on. \"Mrs. P. has only gotten worse since she found out she\u2019s going to have another baby.\"\n\n\"I can\u2019t believe that we know what the baby is going to be, and the rest of the BSC members don\u2019t. They don\u2019t even want to know, Mary Anne.\"\n\n\"They want to be surprised, that\u2019s all,\" I said.\n\n(BSC stands for the Baby\u2011sitters Club. Dawn and I and a bunch of our friends belong to it. I\u2019ll tell you about it later.)\n\nWho am I? I\u2019m Mary Anne Spier. I live in an old (very old) farmhouse with Dawn, my father, and Dawn\u2019s mother. In case you\u2019re wondering, Dawn and I have been friends longer than we\u2019ve been stepsisters. After our parents got married, Dad and I and my kitten, Tigger, moved into Dawn\u2019s house. That\u2019s because it\u2019s bigger than my old house was. Since we\u2019re pretty new at being a family, I call Dawn\u2019s mother Sharon, and Dawn calls my father Richard. That feels more comfortable than Mom and Dad. All things considered, our family is coming together pretty well. We have our tough times (what family doesn\u2019t?), but the good times are getting to be more frequent, and they last longer.\n\nLet\u2019s see. I have brown hair, brown eyes, and a boyfriend! His name is Logan Bruno. Sometimes it\u2019s hard for me to believe I have a boyfriend. That\u2019s for two reasons: 1. I\u2019m really shy. I bet I\u2019m the shyest eighth\u2011grader at Stoneybrook Middle School. 2. For awhile now, Logan and I haven\u2019t been getting along all that well. We\u2019ve hit a few rough patches. There was the time when Dawn, Claudia (another BSC member), and four kids went on a sailing trip and got stranded on a little island off the coast. (It\u2019s a long story.) Practically everyone here in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, was looking for them or worrying about them. (I was a worrier. I wanted to be a searcher, but I have very fair skin, so I can\u2019t stay out in the sun too long.) Anyway, right before the sailing accident, Logan and I had a fight. It was a big one, but it was over the smallest thing. I learned something from that fight. I learned that Logan and I don\u2019t always trust each other. And I learned that Logan can\u2019t always be counted on in a crisis. He wasn\u2019t there when I needed him the most. I thought he could put our fight aside while our friends were lost at sea. But he couldn\u2019t, or didn\u2019t, until just before the end of the crisis.\n\nWe did make up after that, but it hasn\u2019t been our only fight. We had a pretty good one during another crisis \u2014 when Tigger was missing. Tigger is little! He\u2019s just a bundle of soft, gray, tiger\u2011striped fur and a lot of purrs. He could have been in big trouble (although it turned out he wasn\u2019t). So while he was missing, I was scared to death \u2014 and Logan and I weren\u2019t getting along.\n\nLogan and I have had some other difficult times, too. This is hard to believe, since everything was so great when we first met and realized we liked each other. For one thing, I couldn\u2019t fathom that a boy even liked me. I was shy, mousy Mary Anne. And Logan was this drop\u2011dead handsome guy. He looks exactly like my favorite star, Cam Geary. Plus, he\u2019s from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has a wonderful Southern drawl. Everyone loves the way he sounds. Yet Logan chose me for his girlfriend. We\u2019ve given each other gifts, gone to school dances together, and been out on dates. Plus, Logan was with me the day I chose Tigger at the animal shelter.\n\nSo Logan and I started off with a great relationship. But lately he\u2019s been a little pushy. At least, that\u2019s the way it seems to me. Sometimes I wonder if I\u2019m falling out of love with Logan, but I don\u2019t think so. Not over a few tiffs and misunderstandings.\n\n\"So, anyway,\" I said to my stepsister, \"do I look nice enough for Her Highness?\"\n\n\"Like a real princess,\" Dawn answered, even though I was just wearing jeans and a new baggy sweater. \"Go find your crown and you\u2019ll be all set.\"\n\nI laughed. Then I checked my watch. \"I better get going,\" I said. \"I\u2019m supposed to be there in twenty minutes.\"\n\nThe phone rang then, and Dawn said, \"I\u2019ll get it. You find your crown.\"",

          "text": "\"And now, mademoiselles, if you please: a pas de bourr\u00e9e couru, en cinqui\u00e8me, with port de bras, ending in an arabesque. One at a time, please \u2026 and begin!\" Mme Noelle banged her stick on the floor to emphasize her words.\n\nA stranger might have thought they\u2019d wandered into some other world \u2014 and in a way, they\u2019d be right. A ballet studio is another world \u2014 a world where movement is everything, and where words are shorthand for what our bodies should be doing.\n\nPah deh boure-ay koo-roo? On sank-eeyem? With por deh brah? And an ara-besk? Sounds crazy, but what Mme Noelle, our teacher, wanted us to do was to move on our toes across the floor, holding our arms in graceful patterns, and end by standing on one toe with our arms held out to the sides. That\u2019s what all those words meant. They\u2019re French.\n\nI don\u2019t speak French, but I know those words, and a lot of others, because French is the language of ballet, and I\u2019ve been studying ballet since I was four. I\u2019m eleven now, so that\u2019s a long time!\n\n\"Jessica Romsey, please take your turn!\" said Mme Noelle.\n\nJessica Romsey, that\u2019s me. Except most people call me Jessi, and my last name\u2019s Ramsey, not Romsey. It\u2019s just that elegant accent of Mme Noelle\u2019s; everything comes out sounding kind of \u2014 well, kind of fancy.\n\nI closed my eyes for a second, picturing what I was about to do. I wanted to do the best pas de bourr\u00e9e I\u2019d ever done. Why? Because this was the final stage in the final auditions for a big production that was going to be put on by my ballet school. We were going to be putting on The Sleeping Beauty. And I was trying out for the lead!\n\nI took a deep breath, let it out slowly, and rose onto my toes. Then I began. I was so focused that I was hardly aware of Mme Noelle\u2019s attention, but I knew she was watching every single muscle in my body, checking to make sure that I was in complete control.\n\nNormally, as I bourr\u00e9e\u2019d past her, Madame would be making comments like, \u201cLong neck, Mademoiselle Romsey!\u201d or, \u201cUse zee onkles!\u201d (That\u2019s \u201cankles,\u201d just in case you were wondering.) But this wasn\u2019t a class. This was an audition. And I was on my own.\n\nI finished the bourr\u00e9e and went into an arabesque, stretching my arms gracefully (I hoped). Then I clomped off the stage area, my toe shoes clacking with every step.\n\nI watched the other girls do what I\u2019d done, one at a time. There are a lot of good dancers in my class, which makes sense \u2014 it is, after all, an advanced class. Take Mary Bramstedt, for example. Right then she was bourr\u00e9e-ing across the floor, in perfect form. She always seems to be in perfect form. But I think (and this is just my personal opinion \u2014 I\u2019d never say it out loud) that there\u2019s something missing when she dances. Something like \u2014 I know this might sound really silly but \u2014 passion. She\u2019s kind of like a robot, you know?\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone could mistake me for a robot \u2014 and not just because I\u2019m not always in perfect form. As far as I know, there aren\u2019t too many black robots running around \u2014 in fact, there are probably even fewer black robots than there are black ballerinas.\n\nLuckily, there are a few black ballerinas now. Twenty years ago, there weren\u2019t any. And someone like me, with skin the color of cocoa and eyes like coal, could never have dreamed of joining a ballet company. But now I can dream. And it makes me glad, because I absolutely, positively love to dance.\n\nSo does Carrie Steinfeld, and it was showing as she did her bourr\u00e9e. She\u2019s a great dancer \u2014 one of the best in the class. She\u2019s also one of the oldest students in the class, and she\u2019ll be graduating soon. This might be her last chance to get a starring role in a production \u2014 a role that would really give her an edge if she could add it to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nWithout having had a role like Princess Aurora, the leading part in The Sleeping Beauty, Carrie might have a hard time getting into another dance school for older students. And she\u2019d have hardly any chance at all of joining a ballet company. The ballet world is very competitive.\n\n\"Very nice, Mademoiselle Steinfeld,\" said Mme Noelle. I bit my lip. She hadn\u2019t said anything when I finished my bourr\u00e9e. I tried not to worry about it. It might not mean a thing, after all.",

That was not too long ago, when my dad was transferred to the Stamford office of his firm. The move was tough on the whole family.\n\nIt was tough for the usual reasons \u2014 leaving friends and family, coming to a strange new place \u2014 but there were other reasons that made it even worse. The neighborhood we used to live in, in New Jersey, was completely integrated. So were the schools. But in Stoneybrook, it\u2019s different. Here there are very few black families. People just weren\u2019t used to seeing black faces \u2014 and they didn\u2019t make us feel too welcome. In fact, it was the opposite.\n\nBut over time, we\u2019ve all made friends in Stoneybrook, and our lives have settled down. I\u2019d have to say that my family is pretty happy here now. And for me, one of the best parts of the move was getting into this dance school. The school isn\u2019t actually in Stoneybrook \u2014 it\u2019s in Stamford, where my dad\u2019s office is. It\u2019s one of the best on the East Coast \u2014 if you don\u2019t count the really big ones in New York City. And Mme Noelle is known throughout the ballet community as an excellent teacher.

(That was a number of chapters before the one we were already working on.) \u201cThe pluperfect,\u201d I muttered, and began to read.\n\nThe next thing I knew, an announcement was coming over the loudspeaker. \u201cStation stop, Pennington. This is Pennington!\u201d\n\nPennington! That was more than halfway to New York! I\u2019d fallen asleep and had just wasted over an hour\u2019s worth of studying time.\n\nI yawned and stretched. Yechh. I felt awful. No wonder I\u2019d fallen asleep. Maybe I was coming down with something again. Boy \u2026 was I thirsty. Did I have a fever? I didn\u2019t care. All I knew was that I needed something to drink \u2014 desperately. I was opening my change purse when I remembered that the train didn\u2019t have a snack car. Now what was I going to do? Well, I don\u2019t need to have a soda, I told myself. Water will do just fine.\n\nI looked behind me. Thank goodness there was a bathroom on my car. A bathroom would have running water and little paper cups, wouldn\u2019t it?\n\nSort of. I mean, I was half right. The bathroom, which, by the way, didn\u2019t smell so hot, had a sink with nice, cold running water. It even had a bar of dirty pink soap and a stack of paper towels. But there were no cups.\n\nI thought of this silly fold\u2011up plastic cup that Mom used to bring along on vacations \u2014 for situations just like this. I used to tease her about that cup. Now I would have paid her for it.\n\nI stood in the bathroom and thought. The idea of not drinking some water didn\u2019t even occur to me. It was just a question of how to drink it. Finally I decided that there was only one thing to do. Wrinkling my nose, I washed my hands with the dirty soap. I figured that washing my hands with dirty soap was cleaner than not washing them at all. When I finished, I turned off the hot water, cupped my hands under the cold water, and drank \u2026 and drank \u2026 and drank. Ooh. At that moment, nothing \u2014 not even chocolate \u2014 would have tasted as good as that water did.\n\nI went back to my seat.\n\nFive minutes later I was thirsty again.\n\nBy the time I reached Grand Central Station, I had gotten up for drinks of water six more times. (And I had been to the bathroom twice.)",

I didn\u2019t think I could hide it any longer.\n\n\u201cWhat about dinner?\u201d asked Dad.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019ve been starving all day \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d Dad interrupted.\n\n\u201cYes. Breakfast and lunch.\u201d (I didn\u2019t mention the package of M&M\u2019s that I\u2019d sneaked while I was hiding in the girls\u2019 room.) \u201cBut I\u2019m still hungry. The only thing is, I\u2019m tired, too. I\u2019d like to go out to dinner.

We ate dinner in the kitchen, which was much more relaxing than eating out, even at the Sign of the Dove. I changed into jeans, and Dad and I just sat around and talked and ate.\n\nI considered calling Laine, but by nine o\u2019clock I was so relaxed that I yawned and said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll go to bed now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d Dad looked surprised.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m really zonked.\u201d Thirsty, too, but I didn\u2019t say so.\n\nIt was hard to hide this from Dad, though. His apartment is not all that big. There\u2019s only one bathroom, and it\u2019s closer to his bedroom than to mine. So he heard me when I kept getting up all night for drinks of water. (At least Dad\u2019s bathroom has clean soap and my own personal glass.)\n\nOnce during the night, Dad was waiting for me when I came out of the bathroom. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked. \u201cI knew we shouldn\u2019t have ordered from the deli.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, my stomach\u2019s fine,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m still so thirsty. I keep drinking water and then I have to go to the bathroom all the time.\u201d\n\nDad frowned. \u201cWe should check your blood sugar level.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d It was three\u2011thirty. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m falling asleep. Tomorrow.\u201d I made my getaway as quickly as I could.\n\n* * *",

When he couldn\u2019t reach my doctor immediately, he put me in a cab and we rode to the nearest hospital.\n\nSaturday had been a good day for Claud. At least that\u2019s what she said the first time we had a chance to talk after I was admitted to the hospital. The cab had taken Dad and me to one of New York\u2019s finest. However, having been in a number of hospitals, I can tell you that no matter what \u2026 the food stinks. It makes the food in our school cafeteria look \u2014 and taste \u2014 like gourmet dishes prepared by a great chef of the world. In a hospital nowadays, everything that can be is individually wrapped \u2014 a slice of bread in a plastic wrapper, juice in a disposable plastic cup with a foil lid, etc. I would look at my plate after a meal, and it would practically be hidden by a pile of plastic and foil and paper.\n\nWhat a waste.\n\nIf one person in one hospital generates this much trash, I thought, after my first \u201cfactory\u2011fresh\u201d meal, how can our environment possibly deal with it? How can \u2014 Oops. I am way off the track. I\u2019ll tell you about the hospital later. What I started to tell you about was Claudia and her good day. It began with a pottery class.

She\u2019s Japanese-American and totally stunning, with silky black hair, almond\u2011shaped eyes, and a perfect complexion. She\u2019s got a great figure, too, despite the fact that she is a junk food fanatic. You can\u2019t spend two minutes in Claudia\u2019s room without her pulling a Ring\u2011Ding or a Twinkie or a Snickers bar out of some hiding place. She\u2019s got all kinds of art supplies, too, but those are out in the open. Claudia\u2019s main thing (besides junk food) is art. You name it, she can do it well \u2014 painting, drawing, sculpting, jewelry making \u2026 even the way she dresses is artistic. For instance, she walked into school today wearing a bright yellow, oversize man\u2019s jacket with rolled\u2011up sleeves; a wide paisley tie right out of the nineteen\u2011sixties; orange stirrup pants; ankle boots; and huge hoop earrings \u2014 and you know what? On her, it looked totally cool.\n\nOh, another passion of Claud\u2019s is Nancy Drew books. She has them hidden around her room, too, because her parents don\u2019t approve of them. They think she should be reading classics or textbooks, like her sister, Janine. Janine\u2019s a certified genius, with one of the highest IQs anyone\u2019s ever heard of. (She\u2019s the kind of person who finds mistakes in the dictionary.) She and Claudia get along okay, but they couldn\u2019t be more different. Claudia doesn\u2019t do very well in school \u2014 probably because she always feels she can\u2019t compete with Janine. Which is too bad, because Claudia\u2019s really smart.

They both have boyfriends sometimes, although no one steady. But that\u2019s where the similarities end. For one thing, Stacey\u2019s got blonde hair and blue eyes, she\u2019s an only child, and \u2014 here\u2019s the best part \u2014 she\u2019s from New York City! Just like I\u2019m a California girl at heart, Stacey\u2019s a real New Yorker. She has a map of the city on her wall, and something called an alternate\u2011side\u2011of\u2011the\u2011street\u2011parking calendar, with cartoons about car\u2011parking (they\u2019re really dumb, but New Yorkers supposedly find them hilarious). Stacey moved to Stoneybrook when her dad was transferred here (he\u2019s a businessman) \u2014 then, when he was transferred again, she moved back to New York. But less than a year after they settled into a new apartment, her parents told her they were getting a divorce \u2014 and Stacey moved with her mother back to Stoneybrook. She could have chosen to stay in the city, but she didn\u2019t. That was a tough decision for her, but we were thrilled when she came back.\n\nStacey\u2019s life is complicated by one other thing, if you can believe it. She has diabetes. That\u2019s a disease in which your body has trouble controlling the level of sugar in your blood. Stacey has to be on a strict diet for life (meaning no sweets) \u2014 and she has to give herself daily injections of a drug called insulin. To tell you the truth, I still don\u2019t know how she can watch Claudia pull out candy left and right and not go totally crazy.",

I have to say, she is good, and she doesn\u2019t even get stage fright. Jessi is also the BSC\u2019s only black member. The Ramseys are one of the only black families in Stoneybrook, by the way.

          "text": "Oh, my family\u2019s so confusing sometimes. Let me start at the beginning. See, my original family was pretty normal. There were my mom and dad and my two older brothers, Charlie and Sam, me, and my little brother, David Michael.\n\nBut just after David Michael was born, my dad walked out on us. He just left. I hear from him now and then, on my birthday (although sometimes he even forgets that) or at Christmas. I think he\u2019s living somewhere in California these days. It was hard on us when he first left, but my mom\u2019s pretty strong, and she did a great job of holding the family together.\n\nAnd then, not too long ago, my mom met this really terrific guy named Watson Brewer. They fell in love and got married \u2014 so now Watson\u2019s my stepfather. After the wedding, we moved across town to live in his mansion.\n\nWatson is a real, true millionaire. Can you believe it? But you\u2019d never know it by the way he acts \u2014 he\u2019s not stuck up or anything. He\u2019s just a regular guy. And he\u2019s a great father to his two kids from his first marriage \u2014 Karen (she\u2019s seven) and Andrew (he\u2019s almost five). They live with us every other weekend and for a couple of weeks during the summer. They\u2019re terrific kids.\n\nSo anyway, once we moved into the mansion, Mom and Watson started to want a baby \u2014 and that\u2019s where Emily Michelle comes in. When Mom first started talking about a baby, I thought she was planning to get pregnant. But then Watson told us that they were going to adopt a little Vietnamese girl \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what they did.\n\nEmily Michelle is two and a half years old, and she\u2019s just about the most adorable thing I\u2019ve ever seen. She doesn\u2019t talk much \u2014 partly because she\u2019s just beginning to understand English. But she\u2019s a real sweetie.\n\nDavid Michael\u2019s seven now, and he loves being a big brother. Emily Michelle looks up to him just like I look up to Charlie (he\u2019s seventeen) and Sam (he\u2019s fifteen).\n\nI haven\u2019t even mentioned Nannie yet \u2014 she\u2019s my grandmother. She moved in with us after we adopted Emily, partly because we needed her help (Mom and Watson both work) and partly because she was tired of living alone. Her husband died years ago.\n\nNannie\u2019s great. She keeps busy and really enjoys life. She has tons of friends, she likes to bowl, and she\u2019s always on the go.\n\nThere are several other members of my family \u2014 but they\u2019re not people. We\u2019ve got a puppy named Shannon \u2014 she\u2019s a Bernese mountain dog, and she\u2019s going to be huge some day. And Boo\u2011Boo is Watson\u2019s cat. He\u2019s old and fat and kind of mean \u2014 but he\u2019s still part of the family. Plus, Karen and Andrew have two goldfish, Crystal Light the Second and Goldfishie.",

          "text": "Now, where was I? Oh, right. I was telling you how bored we all were that day. Well, you\u2019d be bored, too, after playing Clue, Candy Land, Shark Attack (that\u2019s Emily\u2019s favorite), and one lo\u2011o\u2011ng game of Monopoly.\n\nI racked my brain trying to think of something to do. I wasn\u2019t about to turn on the TV \u2014 I only do that as a last resort \u2014 but I couldn\u2019t come up with any other ideas for indoor activities. I kept wishing that the sun would come out so we could go outside, but it refused to budge from behind all those clouds.\n\nShould we make cookies? Nope. Too messy. Mom would be coming home pretty soon, and she\u2019d want to start dinner. Build with Legos? No way. David Michael had told me early in the afternoon that he was sick of Legos.\n\nI got up to put Shark Attack away, and that\u2019s when it hit me. I saw all the magazines and newspapers sitting in their recycling bins on the floor of the hall closet. Collages! We\u2019d make collages.\n\n\u201cYay!\u201d said David Michael when I told him my idea.\n\n\u201cYay!\u201d echoed Emily Michelle. I knew that she\u2019d make more of a mess than a work of art, but I knew she\u2019d have fun, too. She loves fooling around with scraps of paper and glue and Magic Markers.\n\nI grabbed a stack of newspapers and magazines and brought them to the kitchen table. Then I got out safety scissors, glue, crayons and markers, and some paper. I sat David Michael and Emily Michelle at the table and told them to go to it.\n\nPretty soon David Michael was cutting away, his tongue sticking out as he concentrated on not slicing off Darryl Strawberry\u2019s head. It only took Emily Michelle about thirty seconds to get glue all over her hands \u2014 but I let her go wild, since she was wearing old clothes.\n\nI picked up a recent issue of Stoneybrook News, thinking that I might find some interesting things for the two of them to cut out. Most of what I glanced at looked fairly boring, though. There was a long story about the new sewage treatment plant, and another about some people\u2019s fiftieth wedding anniversary.\n\nI kept leafing through the paper, looking for good pictures. Then this ad caught my eye. \u201cCalling All Babies!\u201d it said. It was an ad for the Stoneybrook Baby Parade.\n\nThe",

My dad and my stepmother were at work, and my stepsister was baby\u2011sitting. My stepsister is Dawn Schafer, and she happens to be one of my two best friends. She\u2019s also an eighth\u2011grader at SMS.\n\nI was waiting around to baby\u2011sit, too. Later that afternoon I would be picked up and driven to the Kormans\u2019 house, where I would sit with their three children \u2014 Bill, Melody, and Skylar \u2014 until about nine\u2011thirty. My friends and I baby\u2011sit a lot. In fact, we baby\u2011sit so much that we\u2019ve formed a business called the Baby\u2011sitters Club (or the BSC). A bunch of my friends and I are the regular club members. Six of us live in my neighborhood, but our club president, Kristy Thomas, lives in a fancy area across town, where she moved when her mom got remarried. The Kormans live across the street and one house up from Kristy. I haven\u2019t baby\u2011sat for them too often. Partly, this is because they are new here. (They moved into the house where a family named Delaney used to live.) Anyway, since Kristy lives so close by, she baby\u2011sits for the Kormans more than the rest of us do.",

          "text": "I don\u2019t know why this is true, but it is, at least for me. See, for the longest time I lived with just my dad. My mother died when I was really little, and I don\u2019t remember her. After that it was Dad and me on our own. And I spent a lot of time alone. That was mostly because I didn\u2019t have any brothers or sisters, but also because my father was really strict with me. I think he wanted to prove to everyone that he could raise a daughter just fine, and be both a father and a mother to me. But he made up all these rules! He told me what to wear, how to fix my hair, and how to decorate my room. He wouldn\u2019t let me ride my bicycle downtown or talk on the phone after dinner unless I was talking about homework. And I had to go to bed unreasonably early. It was no wonder I hardly had any friends, except for Kristy Thomas. (We used to live next door to each other. That was before we both moved. Kristy is my other best friend.)\n\nBut things began to change, first slowly, then quite suddenly. The slow changes started when I was finally able to convince my father that I was a middle\u2011schooler, not a baby, and that I was responsible, honest, and all those other good things. When Dad realized that, he loosened the reins. He let me wear my hair however I wanted instead of in two braids. He let me choose my own clothes. (Within reason. I\u2019m not allowed to wear really cool things, such as cowboy boots, the way most of my friends are. And I\u2019m still not allowed to get my ears pierced, although Dad lets me wear clip\u2011ons.) Dad also lightened up on the telephone and bedtime rules.",

The Schafers had been living in California, but when they got divorced, Mrs. Schafer, Dawn, and Dawn\u2019s younger brother, Jeff, moved back here to Stoneybrook. And then Dad and Sharon (that\u2019s Mrs. Shafer) got together (okay, Dawn and I got them together), they dated for what seemed like ages, and finally they got married! That was the sudden change. After the wedding, Dad and I and my kitten, Tigger, moved into Dawn\u2019s house, because it\u2019s bigger. (In case you\u2019re interested, it\u2019s a colonial farmhouse with a real secret passage that might be haunted.) So that\u2019s where I live with my new family. Oh, except for Jeff.

          "text": "Sometime during all these changes, I met Logan, and we became friends and started going out together. This was odd for a couple of reasons. One, if Dad had been as strict as he used to be, I would never have been allowed to date Logan or anyone else. Two, I am the shyest of all my friends \u2014 and I was the first to start dating a boy steadily.\n\nAs I said before, Logan and I grew so close I felt as if we were almost a part of each other. We shared secrets, and we understood each other perfectly. At least, I thought we did. But I began to feel sort of smothered by Logan. Since he knew that I was shy and didn\u2019t necessarily speak up (even though I was honest with him), he began to take charge of things. He would expect me always to be free to go out with him, he\u2019d choose the movie we were going to see, and sometimes he\u2019d even order for me in restaurants \u2014 without asking what I wanted to eat. He wasn\u2019t letting me be me. So after a lot of thinking (and believe me, this took every ounce of courage I had), I finally told Logan I wanted to cool our relationship. I needed time to consider things. Only I guess I took too long, or maybe Logan took things the wrong way. At any rate, our relationship cooled off so much that it froze and snapped in two.\n\nAnd so I missed Logan.\n\nAnd I felt lonelier than I ever had when I was an \u201calone\u201d person and didn\u2019t know what I was missing.",

          "text": "Today \u2014 at exactly 2:15 PM \u2014 my entire life changed. That was when Mr. Dougherty, my creative writing teacher, told my class about Young Authors Day.\n\nI\u2019m Mallory Pike. Most people call me Mal. I\u2019m eleven years old, and I want to be a writer. Correction. I am going to be a writer. And I am going to write about everything. And illustrate my books, too.\n\nAnyway, Mr. Dougherty announced the event to my creative writing class, which is a special one that I was invited to join because of my writing talent. (Does that sound too conceited? I hope not.) I was so thrilled when I was picked for his class because not only is Mr. Dougherty the coolest, funniest, smartest teacher I have ever had, but he has actually had a book published. He\u2019s a real author like I want to be. The kids in my class call him Mr. D. He seems to like it, too. He\u2019s kind of round and jolly, with a big, bushy mustache that he twirls around his finger whenever he\u2019s pleased with something. He always twirls it when we call him Mr. D.\n\nNow, where was I? Oh, right. Young Authors Day. Mr. D told us that it is a special day celebrating future writers. A famous author is going to talk to the whole school about writing and how to get a book published, and then a contest is going to be held, with prizes going to the best writers in Stoneybrook Middle School. There are lots of categories that we can enter: Best Poem, Best Short Story, Best Mystery, Best Illustration of a Story, and (the one I hope to win) Best Overall Fiction for the Sixth Grade. When I told Mr. D that was the category I wanted to enter, his eyes twinkled and he twirled the ends of his mustache. (So I know he was pleased.)\n\nI couldn\u2019t wait to tell Jessi about it. She\u2019s my best friend. Jessica Ramsey is her full name, but no one ever calls her that, except maybe her parents when they\u2019re mad at her. Jessi is beautiful. She\u2019s tall and thin, with wonderful long legs that are just right for a ballerina, which is what she is. And not just any ballerina, either, but one of the best at this really good ballet school she goes to in Stamford. Just to show you how great a dancer she is, Jessi\u2019s had the lead in several major productions recently, including Copp\u00e9lia, in which she played Swanilda. I go to every one of her performances, and so do the rest of my friends in the Baby-sitters Club \u2014 but I\u2019ll tell you about them later.\n\nJessi is the same age as me, eleven. We\u2019re both junior officers in the BSC (Baby\u2011sitters Club). We\u2019re a lot alike except for a few things. First, I come from a huge family with eight kids. And guess what. Three of them are identical triplets. But even though they look alike, Byron, Jordan, and Adam have very different personalities \u2014 especially Byron, who\u2019s quieter and more sensitive than his brothers.\n\nPeople often say we\u2019re stair\u2011step kids, which means that we were born one after the other. And they\u2019re right. You see, I\u2019m the oldest. The triplets, who are ten, are right behind me. My sister Vanessa is nine, Nicky is eight, Margo is seven, and last but not least is Claire. She\u2019s five. Can you imagine eating dinner with that many people every night? It can be a zoo, sometimes. But Mom and Dad don\u2019t seem to be bothered by it. They\u2019re great.\n\nEveryone in my family has chestnut brown hair and blue eyes. And out of all ten of us, Nicky and I are the ones who wear glasses. Which I hate. I\u2019ve begged my parents for contacts, but they say I have to wait until I\u2019m older. I also wear braces. (The clear plastic kind.) And as long as we\u2019re on the subject of things I hate, let\u2019s talk about my nose. I got it from my grandfather. If I could get rid of it, I would.\n\nJessi doesn\u2019t wear braces or glasses, and her family is regular-sized (two parents and three kids, plus her Aunt Cecelia). Jessi\u2019s eight\u2011year\u2011old sister is named Becca (short for Rebecca), and her baby brother is nicknamed Squirt. His real name is John Philip Ramsey, Jr., which is a very big name for such a little guy.\n\nAnother difference between Jessi and me is that she\u2019s black and I\u2019m white. In fact, Jessi is the only black student in the entire sixth grade. It doesn\u2019t mean anything to me, but it did to a lot of people when the Ramseys first moved to Stoneybrook, Connecticut. (That\u2019s where we live.) I\u2019m ashamed to say that some of the people in Stoneybrook were pretty rotten to them at first. But things have gotten much better for the Ramseys.",

When I told her that I had a chance at winning the Best Overall Fiction award for the entire sixth grade, Jessi gave me a hug. The two of us stood on the street corner, where we usually go our separate ways, squealing with excitement.

And Jessi, my best friend, was happy for me.\n\n\u201cJust think!\u201d I said, pushing my glasses up on my nose. \u201cI have the whole weekend to work on my prize\u2011winning short story.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have any idea what you\u2019re going to write about?\u201d Jessi asked.\n\nI shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m planning to hole up in my room and use the next two days to come up with the perfect award\u2011winning idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could write a horse story,\u201d Jessi suggested. \u201cEveryone loves them, especially the ones by \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMarguerite Henry!\u201d we both said at the same time. She\u2019s our favorite author.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to check my journal,\u201d I said after we stopped giggling. (I\u2019m not sure why we were giggling so much. Maybe just because it was Friday and we were happy.) \u201cI\u2019ve written a lot of ideas in there. I think I\u2019ll take a look at it and then decide.\u201d\n\nI keep my journal under my mattress in my bedroom, which I share with Vanessa. Not that I need to hide it from her. She\u2019s a poet and understands a writer\u2019s need for privacy.\n\n\u201cFirst I am going to finish all my homework this afternoon, so I can focus my complete attention on \".",

He doesn\u2019t say many words yet, but he loves to swing, so he made up a word for that pretty quickly.\n\nI am Jessica Ramsey, known as Jessi. I\u2019m eleven years old. My family and I live in Stoneybrook, Connecticut, a small town. We\u2019re sort of newcomers, since we arrived near the beginning of this school year, when I was starting sixth grade. I have a mom and a dad; a sister, Rebecca; and of course Squirt. Both of my parents work. They like their jobs a lot. In fact, Dad likes his so much that when his company told him he was being transferred to the branch office in Stamford, Connecticut, he picked up and moved us Ramseys to Stoneybrook, which is near Stamford. (We used to live in New\u202fJersey.)\n\nRebecca is eight. Just as I go by the nickname Jessi, she goes by the nickname Becca. Becca is a neat little sister. She has a sense of humor and a good imagination, although she\u2019s shy. Sometimes I think she\u2019s too sensitive. Maybe she needs to develop a thicker skin. On the other hand, if she weren\u2019t so sensitive, she might not be so kind and thoughtful. Here\u2019s an example of what makes Becca special. You know how most kids participate in some kind of after\u2011school activity? Like sports or dance lessons or Brownies or Cub Scouts? Well, when Becca decided to try an activity for the first time, she joined the Kids\u2011Can\u2011Do\u2011Anything Club at her school, Stoneybrook Elementary. The club (which the members refer to simply as the Kids Club) is for boys and girls ages eight, nine, and ten, and its purpose is to \u2026 help others. The kids think of ways to help out in the community. Then the two teachers, who volunteer their time to run the club, help the kids carry out their plans. The kids have done all sorts of things. They cleaned up the trash in an empty lot so the mayor could put a park there. They collected food for people who wouldn\u2019t have had a Thanksgiving otherwise. And now they were working on a toy drive. They were collecting new toys to give to the children\u2019s ward at the hospital. Becca always comes home from a Kids Club meeting with a huge smile on her face.\n\nThere are two other members of our household. One is Misty, our hamster. The other is Aunt Cecelia. She moved in to watch Squirt and to give us a hand when Mama went back to work. Becca and I used to call her Aunt Dictator. That was right after she moved in, when she didn\u2019t really understand my family. She was so strict and mean. But now she is much nicer, and we all get along pretty well. The one thing I don\u2019t like about Aunt Cecelia is that she still seems to think she\u2019s my baby\u2011sitter. And I\u2019m already a baby\u2011sitter! Before Aunt Cecelia came, I was always taking care of Becca and Squirt. Now I don\u2019t have the chance very often. Which is a shame because I love to baby\u2011sit and (sorry for bragging) I\u2019m really good at it. I\u2019m good enough to be part of a business called the Baby\u2011sitters Club.",

          "text": "Today, though, I was sitting. It was a weekday afternoon. Mama and Daddy were at work. And Aunt Cecelia had made plans with some friends. So I was in charge of Squirt. And as soon as Becca returned from her Kids Club meeting I would be in charge of her, too.\n\nSquirt had stopped singing \u201cWhing, whing.\u201d In fact, he held his arms toward me. That meant he wanted to get out of the swing. I lifted him up and set him on the ground near our swing set.\n\n\u201cCome on, Squirt. Walk to me!\u201d My brother is beginning to toddle around. It\u2019s a good thing he wears about nineteen diapers. They provide a nice cushion for when he suddenly sits on his bottom, which happens about every ten wobbly steps he takes.\n\n\u201cDa!\u201d cried Squirt, and hurtled himself into my arms.\n\nI heard a clank in our garage then and realized that Becca had come home from school. (The clank was the sound of the kickstand on her bicycle hitting the cement floor.) A few moments later, she rounded the corner into our backyard.\n\n\u201cHi, Becca!\u201d I called.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d Becca\u2019s eyes were downcast. She didn\u2019t smile. She didn\u2019t even greet Squirt, whom she loves as much as I do. (In case you\u2019re wondering, Squirt is not my brother\u2019s real name. His name is John Philip Ramsey, Jr. But when he was born in the Oakley, New\u202fJersey, hospital, he was the smallest baby in the nursery. It was the hospital staff who first called him Squirt, and the name has stuck, even though Squirt isn\u2019t much of a squirt anymore.)\n\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d I asked Becca. \u201cSomething with the toy drive?\u201d\n\nBecca dropped her schoolbag on the ground and sat on the end of the slide. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied, \u201cthe toy drive is going really well. Bellair\u2019s gave us one hundred dollars\u2019 worth of new toys.\u201d (Bellair\u2019s is Stoneybrook\u2019s department store.)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cSo why do you look like you just lost your best fr \u2014?\u201d I stopped talking. Maybe Becca had just lost her best friend. Maybe she\u2019d had a fight with Charlotte Johanssen. Having a fight with a friend is never fun, but for Becca it would be a crushing blow. First of all, she doesn\u2019t make friends easily. Second of all, moving to Stoneybrook was difficult for my family; not just because of who we left behind in New\u202fJersey (our relatives and good friends), but because not everyone in Stoneybrook accepted us in the beginning. That was because my family is black, and only a few black families live in Stoneybrook. People thought we were \u201cdifferent.\u201d But now we\u2019ve settled in and made friends. However \u2014 had something happened between Becca and Charlotte?\n\n\u201cDid you and Char have a fight?\u201d I asked.\n\nBecca looked shocked. \u201cA fight?\u201d she squeaked.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re upset about something.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but \u2026.\u201d\n\nBecause Ms. Simon\u2019s husband is going on a really long trip, and she decided to go with him.

In it, some girl spills a huge glass of chocolate milk on a living room carpet (white, of course). Her mom gets hysterical, then sprays the stain with some carpet cleaner. Out of the can rushes a team of hungry cartoon gremlins. Ta\u2011da! The gremlins eat the stain and the mom hugs the girl, who smiles cutely with one front tooth missing. Happy music plays in the background.\n\nSo realistic. I mean, does anyone ask how the gremlins got in the spray can? Wouldn\u2019t the mom and daughter run away screaming if they really saw those disgusting things? And what happens to the gremlins after they finish? Do they hang out in the house forever?

I\u2019m thirteen, and in eighth grade at Stoneybrook Middle School, in Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I have a hard enough time with normal classes. The first time I heard Janine mention \u201ccalculus\u201d I thought she was talking about a Roman emperor. Then she showed me her book. You know what the strangest thing was? Calculus is supposed to be a kind of math \u2014 but there were hardly any numbers! It was mostly a bunch of squiggles and letters. Janine tried to explain it to me, but I suddenly felt like I\u2019d taken a sleeping pill. Boring!\n\nAs you can gather, my sister and I could hardly be more different. We do both have dark hair and almond\u2011shaped eyes (our family is Japanese\u2011American), but that\u2019s about it. I\u2019m into wild clothes and different hairstyles. That afternoon, for instance, I was wearing a man\u2019s paisley vest I\u2019d found at a yard sale, over a striped button\u2011down shirt with tuxedo\u2011stripe black Spandex stirrup pants, held up with pink\u2011flecked black suspenders. My hair was pulled straight back with a paisley comb, and I was wearing electric\u2011pink ankle boots. The boots really set off the formality of the rest of the outfit, sort of like the punchline of a joke. I think you can tell a lot about people from the way they dress. If you saw me, you might think: artistic, fun\u2011loving, good sense of humor. At least I hope you\u2019d think that.\n\nIf you saw Janine, you\u2019d think: smart, very smart, unbelievably smart. Her hair is always in a page boy, and she\u2019d be perfectly happy wearing a white Oxford blouse and a gray pleated skirt every day. Janine\u2019s main accessory is a book cradled in her right arm. Exactly the way you\u2019d expect someone with a 196 I.Q. to dress.\n\nThat\u2019s right, 196. \u201cNormal\u201d is 100, \u201cbright\u201d is 120, and \u201cgenius\u201d is 150.

Actually it\u2019s a photo of Mimi when she was my age, and it\u2019s amazing how much she looks like me.\n\nSomehow I can\u2019t imagine that Mimi ever had a room like mine, though. It\u2019s \u2026 well, multipurpose. For one thing, it\u2019s the place where I sleep. (No kidding.) For another, it\u2019s my studio.
